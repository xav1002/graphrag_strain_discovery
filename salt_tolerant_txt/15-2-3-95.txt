Abstract." Salt stress is primarily osmotic stress, and halophilic/halotolerant microorganisms have evolved two basic mcchanisms of 
osmoadaplation: the K('l-type and the compatible-solute type, the latter representing a very flexible mode of adaptation making 
use of distinct stabilizing properties of compatible solutes. A comprehensive survey, using HPLC and NMR methods, has revealed 
lhc full diversity of eubacterial compatible solutes found in nature. With the exception of proline (a proteinogenic amino acid) they 
arc characterized as amino acid derivatives of the following types: bctaines, ectoines, N-acetylated diamino acids and N-derivatized 
carboxamides of glutamine. From our present knowledge of biosynthetic pathways it appears that, apart from glycine betaine, all 
nitrogen-containing compatible solutes originate from two major pathways (the aspartale branch and thc glutamate branch). 
Uptakc of compatible solutes from the growth medium (environment) seems to have preference over de novo synthesis. Therefl)re, 
m the natural ecosystem the solutes of primaw producers (mainly glycine betaine), which are readily excreted upon dilution stress, 
certainly play an important role as a 'preferred" solute source for hctcrolrophic organisms, and as a 'vital' source for organisms 
unable to synlhesize their own compatible solutes.

Introduction 
Natural ecosystems classified as extreme by 
human standards (like hot, acid, alkaline or hy- 
persaline environments) are characterized by their 
lack of higher forms of life, but are nonetheless 
inhabited by an abundance of microbial commu- 
nities adapted to these ecological niches. Concen- 
trated salt solutions (brines) are found in natural 
ecosystems like marine ponds and salt marshes 
snbject to evaporation, salt or soda lakes or in 
man-made forms like salterns or salt works [1]. 
Apart from those macrosystems, a variety of less 
conspicuous saline environments provide an addi-

halotolerant microorganisms: e.g. pickled food 
(sauerkraut), fermented products of oriental cui- 
sine (soy souce, fish paste), surfaces of salt-excret- 
ing desert shrubs, skin of man and animal, other 
places exposed to periodical drying like arid soils. 
Salinity - as a major environmental parameter - 
therefore deserves the attention of the ecologist, 
microbial physiologist and even the biotechnolo- 
gist, as the protective mechanisms evolved in 
halophiles may well have commercial applications 
[2].

of brines has been reviewed [3,4]. The chemical 
composition of brines originated from sea water 
(thalassohaline) is relatively uniform and charac- 
terized by NaCI as its major solute. However, 
landlocked lakes of different origin (athalassoha- 
line lakes) may vary widely in their chemical 
composition, the most common types being alka- 
line soda lakes (low in magnesium and calcium) 
and magnesium-rich saline bodies like the Dead 
Sea (Ca/Mg/NaCl-lake), which has severe con- 
sequences for their microflora [1,5]. Apart from 
those present-day macrosystems, the geological 
record in various parts of the world shows quite 
clearly that hypersaline waters once covered huge 
areas (cf. large deposits of rock salt in Europe 
and North America), providing ample time for 
the evolution of halophilic/halotolerant forms of 
life. Organisms thriving at elevated salt concen- 
trations arc classified as cither (slightly, moder- 
ately, extremely) halophilic or just as marine and 
halotolerant, depending on their growth opti- 
mum. Much attention has been paid to the proper 
definition of these terms [6-8] and it is not our 
intention to add to the confusion. While it is 
certainly justified to define a halophilic organism 
as one requiring salt and displaying a growth 
optimum well above marine concentrations (>> 
3%), the definition of halotolerance imposes a 
problem, especially as the degree of tolerance 
observed largely depends on the composition of 
the growth medium. We therefore propose to 
distinguish between organisms tolerating salt due 
to intrinsic protection mechanisms and 'acquired' 
halotolerance based on the accumulation of pro- 
tectants from the environment. 
The spectrum of species found in saline 
biotopes is dominated by microbial (mostly 
prokaryotic) forms of life. The primary producers 
are algae (mainly of the genus Dunaliella) [9], 
cyanobacteria (e.g. Aphanothece halophytica, 
Dactylococcopsis salina, Spirulina platensis, Syne- 
chococcus and Synechocystis species) [10,11] and 
anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (e.g. Ectothio- 
rhodospira halophila, E. halochloris, E. abdel- 
malekii, E. marismortui, Rhodospirillum salexigens, 
R. salinarum) [12-17]. The spectrum of chemoor- 
ganoheterotrophic organisms comprises the well 
known conspicuously coloured archaebacterial Halobacteriaceae [18,19], but also a wide spec- 
trum of halophilic/halotolerant eubacterial re- 
presentatives including Proteobacteria mostly of 
the y-subclass ( Halomonas, Vibrio, Pseudomonas 
species), actinomycetes (Actinopolyspora, Nocar- 
diopsis species) and a whole range of Gram-posi- 
tive rods and cocci (e.g. Bacillus, Micrococcus, 
Marinococcus, Salinicoccus species)[20-22]. Bac- 
teria involved in the sulfur cycle and in the nitro- 
gen cycle have also been reported [23-25]. It 
therefore seems justified to conclude that the 
halophilic/halotolerant microbial world is proba- 
bly no less diverse than their fresh-water counter- 
part; in fact, halophily/halotolerance as such does 
not define a group of phylogenetically related 
microbes but has evolved (or remained) in many 
different groups of organisms. 
Physiological stress response 
Microbes exposed to a saline environment have 
to cope with a number of specific stress factors, 
for example ionic strength and ion composition. 
It is not surprising that the cell membrane form- 
ing the primary barrier displays adaptive changes 
in the face of altering salinity, as has been exten- 
sively studied in halophilic Vibrio and Ectothio- 
rhodospira species [26-28]. The major effect of 
increased salinity on membranc lipid composition 
is a rise in the proportion of anionic lipids (often 
phosphatidylglycerol and/or glycolipids) relative 
to zwitterionic lipids, which has a pronounced 
effect on lipid phase behaviour [29,30]. The other 
unavoidable parameter present in all saline 
ecosystems is osmotic stress. As water is freely 
permeable across the cytoplasmic membrane, a 
non-adapted organism exposed to an environ- 
ment of low water activity (aw = 0.75 for satu- 
rated NaC1) will rapidly loose water and literally 
get 'pickled', a fact which has been used for 
thousands of years for preserving meat, fish and 
vegetables. Osmotic adaptation of halophilic and 
halotolerant microorganisms, therefore, demands 
osmotic equilibrium across the membranc and a 
cytoplasm of similar osmotic strength to the sur- 
rounding medium [ 1,5,6,31].

Halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms 
have thus developed two basic strategies of os- 
moadaptation: (i) the halobacterial or KCI type 
and (ii) the compatible-solute or organic-osmolyte 
type. 
The first mechanism, which has been discov- 
ered in and is typical for members of the 
Halobacteriaceae, achieves osmotic equilibrium 
by maintaining a cytoplasmic salt concentration 
(KCI) similar to that of the surrounding medium. 
This strategy requires a considerable number of 
physiological changes to safeguard all regulatory 
and metabolic functions at high salinity (salt- 
adapted enzymes and cellular components) [32]. 
Organisms employing the KCI strategy generally 
display a relatively narrow adaptation for a spe- 
cific environment. Well-known representatives of 
this group are the halobacteria (Archaea), but 
also eubacterial fermenting and/or acetogenic 
anaerobes ( Haloanaerobium, Halobacteroides, 
Sporohalobacter, Acetohalobium species)[33,34] 
and sulfate reducers (Desulfol~ibrio halophilus, 
Desulf ohalobium retbaense ) [35,36]. 
The second type of osmoadaptation (compati- 
ble-solute type) seems to be wide-spread in eu- 
bacterial halophiles. However, one must bear in 
mind that mostly phototrophic and aerobic 
chemoheterotrophic eubacteria have been exam- 
ined, and that at least some archaebacterial 
methanogens also produce compatible solutes. 
Hence, regarding the mode of osmoadaptation, 
there seems to be no clear distinction between 
the domains Archaea and Bacteria. The use of 
osmolytes has the advantage of a more flexible 
adaptation over a wide range of salinities, while a 
'normal' salt-sensitive enzymatic machinery is 
preserved. Compatible solutes are accumulated 
to cytoplasmic concentrations well above 1 mol/ 
kg water and are best described as organic os- 
molytes responsible for osmotic balance and at 
the same time compatible with the cells' metab- 
olism. The initial definition that these solutes do 
not interact with cellular metabolism and serve a 
purely osmotic function [37], however, does not 
reflect the whole potential of these osmolytes as 
they proved to be effective stabilizers of enzymes, 
providing protection against salinity, high temper- 
ature, freeze-thaw treatment and even drying [38]. The spectrum of compatible solutes 
When we started our investigations with mem- 
bers of the genus Ectothiorhodospira in 1980 we 
could only draw on experience with salt response 
mechanisms of halophilic/osmophilic fungi, algae 
and plants [39-42]. Here the following classes of 
compounds had been reported as compatible so- 
lutes: sugars, for example sucrose and trehalose, 
polyols (mainly glycerol and arabitol), amino acids 
(proline) and betaines. In bacteria, until then, 
only amino acids like proline and glutamic acid 
had been suspected of serving an osmotic func- 
tion. However, the few reports available were not 
only inconclusive, contradicting each other as to 
the presence of an ionic cytoplasma, but had also 
failed to distinguish between de novo synthesis 
and uptake of solutes from the growth medium 
[43-46]. In addition, due to analytical problems, 
the most common compatible solutes remained 
undetected and the apparent failure to meet os- 
motic balance led to the proposal of a hypoos- 
motic cytoplasm [47,48]. 
A comprehensive survey using high-perfor- 
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nu- 
clear magnetic resonance (NMR) on almost all 
halophilic and halotolerant eubacteria available 
from culture collections (about 50 strains) and, in 
addition, on approx. 150 isolates from various 
biotopes like salt lakes, salinas, salt mines and 
similar sites of elevated salinity has revealed the 
full spectrum of eubacterial compatible solutes in 
nature [1,20,22,49], which comprises the following 
classes of compounds (Fig. 1): sugars and sugar- 
polyol derivatives, glycine betaine, tetrahydropy- 
rimidines (ectoines), a-amino acids (proline, glu- 
tamine), N-acetylated diamino acids, N-deriva- 
tized carboxamides of glutamine, and (in 
cyanobacteria and marine algae) also methylated 
sulfur compounds like dimethylsulfoniopropi- 
onate [50]. 
The strains under investigation included 
anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria and aerobic 
chemoheterotrophic Proteobacteria of the ~- and 
y-subdivision, actinomycetes, Gram-positive cocci, 
bacilli and related species as well as Staphylococ- 
cus and Salinicoccus species [20,22,49] and mod- 
erately halotolerant species of the genera Bre-

t'ibacterium and Corynebacterium [51-53]. Tables 
1-3 summarize the results obtained from our 
group and reveal the preferential distribution of 
solutes among various groups of microorganisms. 
On the archaebacterial side, a thorough investiga- 
tion of mcthanogenic species has similarly re- 
vealed a number of characteristic classes of com- 
pounds (not shown), mainly glycine betaine and 
the two /J-amino acids /3-glutamine and Ne-ace- 
tyl-/j-lysine [54-56]. 
Polyols (mainly glycerol and arabitol), often 
found in algae, yeast and fungi [39,40,42,57], have 
so far not been detected in bacteria at osmotically 
relevant concentrations. Instead, glycerol gluco- 
sides have been described in the purple bac- 
terium Rhodobacter sulfidophilus [22,49] and a 
number of moderately halophilic cyanobacteria 
[10,11]. The occurrence of sugars (mainly sucrose 
and trchalose) as part of the solute 'cocktail' 
seems to be very common in a wide range of 
microorganisms. However, they can only partly 
replace nitrogen-containing compatible solutes 
[58] and rarely exceed a cytoplasmic concentra- 
tion of 500 raM. These less-compatible solutes 
are, therefore, typical for organisms of limited 
salt tolerance. They may fail to qualify as compat- 
ible solutes 'sensu stricto' and a possible role as 
universal stress metabolites enabling survival un- 
der adverse conditions has been under discussion 
for a long time [59,60]. Similarly, a potential role 
of methylated sulfur compounds (thetines) as os- 
motic solutes has been suspected for a number of 
cyanobacteria, but, under the conditions tested, 
cytoplasmic concentrations stayed relatively low 
and their importance for osmotic equilibrium of 
truly halophilic species is still under discussion. The same holds true for c~-glutamine, so far only 
reported from moderately halotolerant members 
of the genus Corynebacterium, which due to its 
low solubility (approx. 300 raM) reaches cytoplas- 
mic concentrations near saturation [53]. The most 
important compatible solutes 'sensu stricto' accu- 
mulating to concentrations well above 0.5 M are 
further characterized below. 
Glycine betaine 
Glycine betaine is the typical product of pho- 
totrophic eubacteria, especially of those display- 
ing a high salt tolerance [10,11,61,62], and has 
further been found as a primary product in 
halophilic archaebacterial methanogens [54,55]. 
The ability to synthesize betaine de novo, how- 
ever, is rare among aerobic heterotrophic eubac- 
teria; of all strains examined only Actinopolyspora 
halophila is a betaine producer [22]. 
Ectoines 
Ectoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimi- 
dine carboxylic acid) was first discovered as a 
minor component in the phototrophic sulfur bac- 
terium Ectothiorhodospira halochloris [63]. This 
solute is without doubt the most abundant os- 
molyte of aerobic chemoheterotrophic eubacte- 
ria, and as much as betaine can be regarded the 
typical product of halophilic phototrophic bacte- 
ria, ectoines are common solutes of aerobic het- 
erotrophic eubacteria [22]. The hydroxy deriva- 
tive, often found as a minor component in Pro- 
teobacteria of the y-subdivision and in Nocardi- 
opsis species, seems to be of greater importance 
in Gram-positive eubacteria [22].

Proline 
Among prokaryotes, proline was originally 
considered the typical solute of halophilic Bacil- 
h¢s species. This view was primarily based on 
investigations into Bacillus subtilis and closely 
related species [43]. A thorough screening of a 
whole range of halophilic/halotolerant bacilli and 
related species, however, has revealed that the 
majority of species produce ectoine, either alone 
or in combination with proline and/or acetylated 
diamino acids [64]. Bacillus subtilis and Planococ- 
cus citreus seem to represent a minority of pro- 
line producers unable to synthesize ectoine. 
TabLe 2 N-acetylated diamino acids 
The role of N6-acetylornithin as an osmolyte 
was first shown in one of our own isolates, strain 
M96/12b [65]. This strain belongs to the so-called 
bacillus-related species and, consequently, N6- 
acetylornithine was also detected, at least as a 
minor component, in almost all Bacillus species 
under investigation including related organisms 
like Sporosarcina halophila and Planococcus cit- 
reus. The homologous Ne-acetyllysine, originally 
isolated and identified from Sporosarcina halo- 
phila (Severin & Galinski, unpublished), is also 
found in Planococcus citreus and some bacilli.

N-derivatized glutamine amides 
This very unusual class of compounds has ami- 
dated glutamine as a common structural charac- 
teristic. The free amino residue is typically acety- 
lated or carbamoylated. A novel representative of 
this class of compatible solutes, Na-carbamoyl-L- 
glutamine-l-amide (CGA), has so far only been 
found in the phototrophic bacterium Ectothio- 
rhodospira marismortui, where it amounts to as 
much as 30% of the solute pool [66,67]. A similar 
structural principle is realized with Na-acetylglu- 
taminylglutamine amide (AGGA), another repre- 101 
sentative of this class of osmolytes and so far the 
only neutral dipeptide of osmotic function [68,22]. 
¢3-Amino acids

tation have been reported from halophilic 
methanogenic archaebacteria (Methanohalophilus 
species) [54,55]. /3-glutamine and NE-acetyl-/3- 
lysine, both uncharged zwitterionic compounds, 
are synthesized in response to increasing salinity 
and reach cytoplasmic concentrations well above

Biosynthetic pathways 
Biosynthetic pathways for trehalose, bctainc 
and eetoine in the phototrophic bacterium Ec- 
tothiorhodospira halochloHs have been proposed 
with the help of uC-labelling techniques and 
affirmed on enzymatic grounds ([49,69-72]: I. 
Tschichholz and H.G. Trfiper, unpublished re- 
suits). With a view to the regulation of trehalose 
content, some properties of the cleaving enzyme 
trehalase are worth noting. The enzyme is inhib- 
ited by salt and activated in the presence of 
glycine betaine, which also confers a partial pro- 
tection against salt. In addition, it exhibits a very 
high Kin-value for the substrate trehalose (0.5 
M), close to the maximal concentration reported 
in cells exposed to nitrogen limitation [58]. In the 
presence of glycine betaine this constant is re- 
duced to 0.16 M promoting degradation, hence 
glycine betaine seems to have a regulatory effect 
on trehalose levels in the cytoplasma. These find- 
ings are in agreement with the physiological ob- 
servation that trehalose is only accumulated un- 
der nitrogen-limited conditions (replacing nitro- 
gen-containing solutes) and immediately 
metabolised upon relief of nitrogen stress. 
Contrary to the pathway in cyanobacteria and 
in plants of the family Chenopodiaceae biosyn- 
thesis of betaine in Ectothiorhodospira species 
proceeds via direct methylation of glycin using 
S-adenosyl methionine as a methyl donor (I. 
Tschichholz and H.G. Triper, unpublished re- 
suits). Using beta/betB gene probes, the pres- 
ence of the genes for choline oxidation (betaine 
aldehyde dehydrogenase, choline oxidase) in 
eyanobacteria and their absence in Ectothiorho- 
do,spira species has been demonstrated (O. Matan 
and E. Tel-Or, pers. comm.). In view of the 
observed CO, release from acetate and remark- 
ably high activities of 5,10-methylene-THF-dehy- 
drogenase, a methyl-group supply by cleavage of 
glyoxylate and subsequent reduction of formyl- 
THF has been proposed [49,69]. Recently, again 
using NMR spectroscopic evidence, betaine syn- thesis from glycine has also been proposed for 
archaebacterial methanogens [56]. Therefore, 
phylogenetically distant groups may well share 
similar pathways of compatible solute synthesis. 
On the basis of their observations with cyanobac- 
teria, Sibley and Yopp [73] proposed an intrigu-

glutamine (not shown) as a compatible solute is restricted by 
its low solubility. Zwitterionic sulfur compounds like dimeth- 
ylsulfoniopropionate have so far only been observed in

ing hypothesis of regulation, where methylation is 
inhibited by the reaction product S-adenosyl ho- 
mocysteine. A reversible S-adenosyl-homocy- 
steine hydrolase is stimulated by betaine in the 
direction of S-adenosyl homocysteine formation, 
whereas potassium stimulates hydrolysis of S- 
adenosyl homocysteine to homocysteine. This way 
the level of inhibition and the cytoplasmic con- 
centration of betaine is regulated. 
Biosynthesis of ectoine proceeds via aspartie 
semialdehyde (off-branch of aspartate family) and 
requires three additional enzymes: diaminobu- 
tyrate transaminase, diaminobutyrate acetylase 
and Ny-acetyldiaminobutyrate dehydratase [72]. 
Due to the steric configuration of hydroxyectoine 
(S,S-c~-amino-/3-hydroxy form), an analogous bit)- 
synthetic pathway with erythro-/3-hydroxyaspar- 
tate (from glyoxylate + glycine) seems likely, how- 
ever, subsequent hydroxylation of ectoine or one 
of its precursors cannot be excluded. The fact 
that relatively few and common enzymatic reac- 
tions form the basis for the biosynthesis of these 103 
two novel solutes probably explains why ectoines 
are so widespread among halophilic bacteria. 
A summary of known and hypothetical path- 
ways of compatible solutes is given in Fig. 2. The 
illustration shows that the other solutes such as 
glutamine amide derivatives (Proteobacteria of 
the ~- and y-subclass), proline, N6-acetylornith- 
ine and Ne-acetyllysine (some bacilli and related 
organisms) are probably synthesized via pathways 
connected to the glutamate family. It has never 
been shown but always assumed that osmotically 
used proline is synthesized by the same pathway 
as the proteinogenic compound. As independent 
regulation of both functions is vital, the possibil- 
ity of separate pathways has to be considered. 
Some organisms display a characteristic change 
from proline to N,%acetylornithine and one is, 
therefore, tempted to assume common biosyn- 
thetic sequences (possibly involving ornithine 6- 
aminotransferase). The ability to synthesize and 
use N-acetylated diamino acids as compatible 
solutes seems to be typical for members of the

phylogenetically diverse group of aerobic spore 
formers (bacilli) and related organisms. The con- 
comitant presence of both acetylated diamino 
acids in many of the above organisms, therefore, 
supports the view that both pathways may be 
interrelated and that N-acetylated lysine used for 
osmoadapation is probably derived from a path- 
way uncommon in prokaryotes (and possibly simi- 
lar to the aminoadipic acid pathway AAA, Fig. 
2). 
The biosynthesis of the glutamine amide 
derivatives (CGA and AGGA) is presently under 
investigation. The observation that cytoplasmic 
levels of Na-carbamoyl glutamine amide (CGA) 
rise when glutamine is supplied as a precursor 
may serve as an indication for glutamine-linked 
synthesis [67]. Subsequent biosynthetic steps 
would then involve amidation of glutamine and 
carbamoylation of the amino group (or vice versa); 
however, a separate biosynthetic route starting 
from glutamate or a-oxoglutarate can at present 
not be excluded. 
Environmental implications 
No natural environment is free of change - be 
it on a geological time scale or on a much shorter 
seasonal basis. Highly saline environments are 
subject to 'disturbance' by, though rare, rainfalls 
or local underground or open fresh water sup- 
plies. Thus, their microbial floras are undergoing 
relatively rapid changes caused by dilution stress. 
The sudden dilution of the environmental brine 
of extreme halophiles, osmotically balanced by 
high intracellular solute concentrations, would be 
disastrous (osmotic bursting of cells), unless 
mechanisms were provided to deal with such 
shock events and lower cytoplasmic turgor within 
minutes. Possible response mechanisms would 
entail rapid catabolism, conversion of solutes into 
osmotically inactive forms or extrusion into the 
surrounding medium. Our present state of knowl- 
edge of the organisms' reaction upon 'down- 
shock' (mostly based on phototrophic bacteria) 
reveals a differential treatment depending on the 
solute involved. Whereas trehalose (and possibly 
other sugars) is quickly degraded into activated monomers [70] subject to further metabolism and 
possibly polymerisation into osmotically inert 
storage material, glycine betaine and ectoine are 
rapidly excreted into the medium, i.e. the envi- 
ronment [76]. The well-known mass developments 
of phototrophic bacteria (e.g. cyanobacterial mats) 
in hypersaline environments probably make 
glycine betaine one of the most abundant solutes 
in natural biotopes, where considerable concen- 
trations have been reported from interstitial wa- 
ters of sediments ([74,75], J. Boon pers. comm.). 
As has been shown for E. halochloris, this 
instantaneous response may result in an over- 
shoot reaction, which is subsequently balanced by 
re-uptake of solutes until a steady state is achieved 
[76]. Such release mechanisms for solutes in com- 
bination with uptake systems, as studied for 
glycine betaine in E. halochloris' [77] and in 
cyanobacteria [78,79], are probably widely occur- 
ring in phototrophic primary producers. The ex- 
cretion of glycine betaine (together with other 
solutes) into the environment has interesting con- 
sequences. Besides serving as carbon and nitro- 
gen supply for many chemoheterotrophic aerobes 
[20,22] as well as anaerobes [80], osmolytes re- 
leased into the environment are used by a num- 
ber of halophilic/halotolerant bacteria as an al- 
ternative and easily accessible source of compati- 
ble solutes, provided they posses the necessary 
uptake and regulation systems. In general, 
halophilic bacteria will prefer uptake to de novo 
biosynthesis of species-specific solutes for ener- 
getic reasons. It is, however, important to note 
that even organisms unable to synthesize compat- 
ible solutes themselves may thrive in a saline 
environment if compatible solutes (or suitable 
precursors) are supplied by de novo producers. 
This intriguing possibility is clearly demonstrated 
with the salt-sensitive Escherichia coil and other 
Enterobacteriaceae, which make use of effective 
transport mechanisms for both, betaine and ec- 
toine [81-84], and acquire a certain degree of 
halotolerance (at least 5% NaC1) if these solutes 
are supplied with the medium. In addition, some 
halobacteria, strictly anaerobic fermenting bacte- 
ria as well as dissimilatory sulfate reducers, which 
all use the archaebacterial type of osmoadapta- 
tion and do not need compatible solutes for os-

motic purposes, also use small amounts of glycine 
betaine ([85]: E.A. Galinski, unpublished results). 
Therefore, compatible solutes play an important 
role in saline ecosystems, both as alternative os- 
molytes for solute producers and as vital supple- 
ments for others depending on these solutes. 
These interrelations have pronounced conse- 
quences, not only for our understanding of micro- 
bial interaction in saline ecosystems but also for 
the enrichment and isolation of organisms from 
such habitats. As media supplements like yeast 
extract contain considerable amounts of glycine 
betaine (1-3% dry weight) (E.A. Galinski, unpub- 
lished results), it is not surprising that use of even 
moderate concentrations (e.g. 0.05%) may lead to 
the enrichment of organisms able to accumulate 
and use betaine as a compatible solute. Other 
halophilic organisms with complex nutrient re- 
quirements, lacking a glycine betaine uptake sys- 
tem, are therefore outgrown, unless betaine-free 
media supplements are used. Similarly, a het- 
erotrophic bacterial flora specialized for other 
available solutes like ectoines, acetylated diamino 
acids or glutamine amide derivatives still awaits 
isolation and thorough investigation.
