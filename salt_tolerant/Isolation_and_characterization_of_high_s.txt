ABSTRACT 
 
Adaptation characteristic of microorganisms in diff erent extreme conditions seeks discoveries in field  of pharma, 
food, & bioenergy sectors.  In the present study, n ew experimental approach was proposed to prove adap tation 
ability in extreme conditions with growth and devel opment of agricultural soil bacterial species in st epwise 
adaptation in high salt (NaCl) conditions. Six diff erent bacterial species were isolated from agricult ural soil 
surrounding the Rajkot region. Out of six isolates,  two showed salt tolerance up to 10% NaCl concentra tion. 
Biochemical and molecular (16S rDNA sequencing) cha racterization revealed the strains to be Exiguobact erium sp. 
and Serratia sp.  designated as  GSD1 and GSD 2 str ains. Species were able to adapt upto 10% of NaCl i n nutrient 
broth growth medium. Primary screening for extracel lular enzymes (protease, amylase, lipase) secretion  unveiled 
activity of enzymes in nutrient agar plates contain ing skim milk or starch or mineral oil for protease , amylase and 
lipase production respectively. This experiment pro vides the base to link the adaptation capabilities of agricultural 
soil microorganisms in high salty environment and v ice a versa.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Adaptation is an evolutionary process through which  living organisms develop to live in its changed ha bitats. Lower 
to higher living organisms are influenced but devel oped to adjust with different abiotic stresses i.e.  changes in 
salinity of soil and water, temperature, pH, atmosp heric humidity, air circulation and radiation [1,2] .  Amongst these 
all soil and water salinity is the major stress imp acts on life, and it becomes more prominent with ti me.  
 
Global warming is the key issue of current world en vironmental problems, its main emphasis on level an d surface 
temperature of sea. The scientific committee on Ant arctic research proposed a rise in mean sea level o f up to 1.4 m 
by 2100 century and other scientists anticipated se a level rise of one to several meters[3-5] in the s ame phase. 
Reports  year[6].Gujarat has 1663 km, coastal regio n and rise in 0.5 meter sea level can cover roughly  8452.971 
Km2 land nearby coastal area[6]. This can be even more  anti-agricultural if sea level rises about 0.5 to 1.4 meters[7]. Gaurav S. Dave  et al Euro. J. Exp. Bio., 2013, 3(6):351-358

Pelagia Research Library  Similarly, with global warming, natural disasters l ike earthquake and tsunami will cost more deadly ef fects on 
microorganisms of agricultural soil. Recently, stro ked tsunamis in South Asia has affected 11,000 Ha a gricultural 
land [8], with 4067 Ha cropped area and 2260 km of coastal area in India alone[9].  Tsunami contaminat ed the 
agricultural soil with salts of Kerala, Andhra Prad esh, Tamilnadu and Pondicherry states of India. In future, natural 
disasters like tsunami if strike in Gujarat it may contaminate the agricultural soil of Rajkot, Jamnag ar, Junagadh, 
Porbandar, Surat and Kutch districts and it will af fects the microorganisms population in agricultural  soil. In future 
high salt contaminated soil, either it will lose so me of the microorganisms’ species or microorganisms  have to adapt 
to salty soil. 
 
In view of this, we have focused on microorganisms of non-saline soil to adapt it in high salt concent ration in 
artificial synthetic media. We have isolated the to tal six bacterial species from agricultural garden soil of Saurashtra 
University campus and experimented to evaluate its adaptability in high salinity medium. Out of total six isolates we 
have found two isolates Exiguobacterium  sp. GSD1 (JN020918) and  Serratia sp. GSD2 (JN020917) with capability 
to adapt upto 10% of NaCl salt containing medium. 
 
Exiguobacterium  sp. have been isolated from markedly diverse sourc es, including Greenland  glacial ice, hot springs 
at Yellowstone  park, rhizosphere of plant and environment of food  processing unit[10].Gram negative bacteria of the 
genus Serratia are opportunistic human, plant and insect pathogen s[11]and member of the family 
enterobacteriaceae [12]. Salinity has an effect on microbial cell memb rane[13] and synthesis, structure and function 
of protein [14,15] as well as the growth of the mic roorganisms [16]. Bacteria develop different defens e mechanisms 
to survive in high salinity environment [17].Presen t study evaluates the adaptation capabilities of ag ricultural soil 
microorganisms in high NaCl containing medium to pr opose its futuristic adaption in salt contaminated soil, if 
tsunami like natural disaster strikes or rise in se a level, change the fertility of soil. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Collection of soil sample and physico-chemical anal ysis:  Soil sample was collected from provinces of “Van -
Vibhag” (agricultural soil) Saurashtra University c ampus, Rajkot, India. Soil sample was collected fro m the depth of 
10-12 inch in sterile polythene bag and samples wer e kept at room temperature until used. Soil analysi s was 
conducted to measure electro conductivity, pH, tota l nitrogen, K 2O, P2O5 content at the government soil analysis 
laboratory, Rajkot.  
 
Isolation and Screening of Bacteria : Soil suspension was prepared with 5g of soil in 2 0ml of sterile double 
distilled water and vortexed. Loop full of soil sus pension was streaked on N-Agar plates (Himedia) and  incubated 
for 24h at 37 °C for isolation of different bacteria.  Total six d ifferent isolates were found from primary screening  
and further grown on N-agar plate containing 2%, 4% , 6%, 8% & 10% NaCl separately for 72h at 37 °C. 
 
Biochemical Characterization: Biochemical analysis of two isolates were carried o ut according to Bergey’s 
Manual of Determinative Bacteriology[18] and classi fied primarily through morphological, physiological  and 
biochemical  observation.   
 
Amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA encoding g enes: 16S rDNA genes, from the purified genomic DNA 
of the 2 isolates were amplified by PCR with the fo llowing set of primers: F (5´-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-
3´) and R (5´-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3´). Each 50-µl r eaction mixture contained 30 mM Tris (pH 8.4), 
50mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 50mM concentrations of each dNTPs, 10 pmol of eac h primer, and 1U of Taq 
polymerase. The PCR was performed  with following s pecification: first step of denaturation for 5 min at 95°C,  30 
cycles were performed, denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55°C, and polymerization  for 1 min at 
72°C. The amplified genes were sequenced using sequ ence scanner v1.0 (Inst Model/Name: 3730XI/ABI3730X L-
1414-008) (Applied Biosystems). 
 
Phylogenetic analysis: The 16S rDNA gene sequences of two isolates ( Exiguobacterium sp.  GSD1, Serratia 
sp.GSD2) were compared to references of 16S rDNA ge ne sequences retrieved from GenBank database. BLAST N 
2.2.26+ used to retrieve similar reference sequence s and aligned for phylogenetic relationship with ou r isolated 
strain by neighbor-joining method using treedyn onl ine software.

Pelagia Research Library  GeneBank Submission and nucleotide accession number : 16S rDNA gene sequences of Exiguobacterium  and 
Serratia were deposited in the NCBI GenBank under accession  numbers JN020918 and JN020917 respectively. 
 
Growth Curve:  Vegetative cells of Exiguobacterium sp. GSD1 and Serratia sp. GSD2 were grown in a nutrient 
broth containing 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% & 10% of NaCl. Cont rol tubes were served without addition of NaCl. 0.1  ml of 
fresh culture (O.D near about 1.000 at 660nm) was i noculated in medium. O.D was measured of the sample  at 
660nm with (UV-1800, SHIMADZU) at duration of 1h fo r 33h. 
 
Extracellular enzyme production at different salt c oncentration 
Amylase production:  Amylase production was analyzed by starch hydrolyz ing method.  Starch agar plate was 
prepared containing 4% and 8% NaCl. Organisms were inoculated on starch agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 
24h. Amylase production was detected as a colorless  zone on surrounding of colony on addition of iodin e.  
 
Proteolysis production:  Skim milk agar plates were prepared containing 4% and 8% NaCl, organisms were 
inoculated. Dissolved casein surrounding the colony  resulted on secretion of protease enzyme. 
 
Lipase production:  Nutrient agar plates containing vegetable oil prep ared to study extracellular lipase activity. Test 
organisms were inoculated and incubated for 24h at 37°C. Addition of CuSO 4 in plates on next day develops bluish 
green appearance surrounding the colony, confirms t he hydrolysis of fat in glycerol & fatty acid.

DISCUSSION 
 
The present study was designed to evaluate the adap tation properties of agricultural soil microorganis m under the 
high salt (NaCl) growth medium to establish the ada ptability characteristics of non-saline agricultura l soil 
microorganism in saline medium. Exiguobacterium sp. GSD1 strain and Serratia sp. GSD2  were the isolates 
utilized for experiments. 
 
Exiguobacterium  sp. has been found from much wide range of habitat s of all over the world. Exiguobacterium  sp. 
exhibits in wide range of habitats including cold a nd hot environments with temperature range from -12 °C to 
55°C[19]. This diversification in habitats of Exiguobacterium sp. is responsible of its adaptation in diverse 
conditions and beneficial to survive against extrem e environmental factors. Exiguobacterium  genus comprises 
psychrotrophic, mesophilic, and moderate thermophil ic species[20,21], with pronounced morphological di versity 
(ovoid, rods, double rods, and chains) depending on  species, strain, and environmental conditions[22].  Our 
experimental results of growth curve of Exiguobacterium  sp. GSD1, suggest the down-regulation of growth under 
successive increase of NaCl concentration. As shown  in figure 3, without additional NaCl concentration  in growth 
medium it did not affect the growth of organism but  as the concentration of NaCl increases, growth of organisms 
decreased with maximum tolerance upto 10% NaCl conc entration. Several Exiguobacterium  strains possess unique 
properties of interest for application in biotechno logy, bioremediation, industry and agriculture. Exiguobacterium  sp. 
are capable of neutralizing highly alkaline textile  industry wastewater[23], high potential for pestic ide removal[24] 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6

kinase, ATPases, dehydrogenase, esterase) with stab ility at a broad range of temperatures were purifie d from 
different Exiguobacterium  strains [26-31]. Our isolates Exiguobacterium  sp.GSD1 showed extracellular enzyme 
production of protease, lipase and amylase on N-aga r plate with additional food material respectively casein, mineral 
oil and starch. Plate results reveal that enzyme se cretion was decreased with increase in salt concent ration with 4% 
and 8% NaCl in comparison to 0% NaCl, this observat ion was made on the basis of zone of enzyme product ion. In 
view of this we can assume that enzymes would be se creting in extracellular environment but because of  high salt 
concentration in medium, enzymes could not be activ e fully or decrease in growth of microorganism dire ctly affects 
the production of extracellular enzymes. From the o bservation on production of enzyme, we can deduce t hat as salt 
concentration increases, it decreases the activity of enzyme, but high salt concentration could not in hibit the enzyme 
activity completely. These results are in hope and favor to develop and upgrade strategies for enzyme production 
sustainable in high saline medium. Report on Exiguobacterium  255-15 isolated from Siberian permafrost  showed 
potential stress responses with changing growth rat e, cellular morphology, cell membrane composition, 
polysaccharide composition, and carbon utilization under different temperature conditions and wide ran ge of salt 
concentration makes Exiguobacterium  dynamic organism to survive and study for evolutio nary linkages[32]. 
 
Our isolated Serratia sp. GSD2showed growth upto 10% NaCl in growth medi um, with supporting results same on 
agar plate at 10% NaCl. Previously, Serratia species has been isolated from water, soil, skin o f animals (including 
man) and from the surfaces of plants. Serratia sp.  grows at temperature range from 5–40° and pH range  from 5 to 
9[33,34]. Strains of this species produce plant-gro wth-promoting chemicals, have anti-fungal and anti parasitic 
properties, encourage the establishment of nitrogen -fixing symbionts and act as insect pathogens [35-3 8]. These 
observations revealed that in future if any agricul tural soil area covered with saline environment by any natural 
disaster, our isolated Serratia sp. will be a natural remedy for removal of NaCl t o keep agricultural soil fertile. A 
subspecies of Serratia marcescens  (S. marcescens  subsp. sakuensis ) and a urea-dissolving species ( Serratia 
ureilytica ) have been described previously [39-40]. In our is olated Serratia sp.GSD2 species, we have found biofilm 
production[41], which increase with increase in sal t concentration from 0 % to 10 % NaCl salt concentr ation. In this 
present experiment Serratia sp. GSD2 also produces extracellular enzymes amyla se, protease and lipase. We have 
found decrease in extracellular enzyme activity as increase in salt concentration ranging from 0%, 4%,  8% NaCl. 
 
Protein content in terms of total gene expression w as increased with increase in salt concentration as  shown in 
Exiguobacterium  sp. GSD1  & Serratia sp. GSD2, as well as gradual decline in extracellul ar enzyme activity was 
also observed in proteinase, lipase and amylase upt o 8% NaCl in solid medium.  Biochemical and biophys ical data 
have been postulated for several salt-tolerant enzy mes, including glutaminase from Lactobacillus rhamnosus [42] α-
amylase from Bacillus dipsosauri [43], protease from Aspergillus  sp. FC-10[44], α-type carbonic anhydrase from 
Dunaliella Salina [45]and thermolysin from B. thermoproteolyticus [46], Lipase from Pichia anamola [47]. 
Halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms have var ious mechanisms to adapt against high salt concentr ation i.e. 
synthesis of betaine, Ectoine and hydroxyectoine, β-Glutamate, trehalose etc.[48,49], any of or all of  these 
mechanism would be followed in our isolated microoo rganisms under high salt media. Diminished extracel lular 
enzyme activity on increase in salt concentration i n our experiments are in support that halophilic en zymes are found 
to have multilayered hydration shells that are of c onsiderably of greater size and order compared to n on-halophilic 
enzymes[50]. 
 
In conclusion, this study provides the futuristic a spect of agricultural soil microorganisms on adapta tion and use as a 
natural fertilizer, whenever any nature disaster li ke tsunami strikes the coastal region of Saurashtra  (Gujarat). The 
above studied microorganism Exiguobacterium and Serratia will able to survive in high salt condition and co uld be 
the possible factor to revive fertility of agricult ural soil and removal of salt contamination. Furthe r, extracellular 
enzyme production by Exiguobacterium  and Serratia opens the doors for its application in food, pharm a and 
bioenergy industries. In view of the above, present  study provides the possible natural bioremediation  approach for 
famers of Saurashtra  region of Gujarat state as well as possible microb iological survivor in future under any natural 
disaster like tsunami or earthquake.
