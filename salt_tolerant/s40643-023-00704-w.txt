Abstract 
Different microorganisms can produce different proteases, which can adapt to different industrial requirements 
such as pH, temperature, and pressure. Salt-tolerant proteases (STPs) from microorganisms exhibit higher salt toler -
ance, wider adaptability, and more efficient catalytic ability under extreme conditions compared to conventional 
proteases. These unique enzymes hold great promise for applications in various industries including food, medicine, 
environmental protection, agriculture, detergents, dyes, and others. Scientific studies on microbial-derived STPs 
have been widely reported, but there has been little systematic review of microbial-derived STPs and their applica-
tion in high-salt conventional soybean fermentable foods. This review presents the STP-producing microbial species 
and their selection methods, and summarizes and analyzes the salt tolerance mechanisms of the microorganisms. It 
also outlines various techniques for the isolation and purification of STPs from microorganisms and discusses the salt 
tolerance mechanisms of STPs. Furthermore, this review demonstrates the contribution of modern biotechnology 
in the screening of novel microbial-derived STPs and their improvement in salt tolerance. It highlights the potential 
applications and commercial value of salt-tolerant microorganisms and STPs in high-salt traditional soy fermented 
foods. The review ends with concluding remarks on the challenges and future directions for microbial-derived STPs. 
This review provides valuable insights into the separation, purification, performance enhancement, and application 
of microbial-derived STPs in traditional fermented foods.

Graphical Abstract
Introduction
Proteases are a class of enzymes that hydrolyze pro -
teins, breaking them down into smaller peptides and 
amino acids (Aguilar and Sato 2018; Razzaq et al. 2019). 
Depending on the peptide bond hydrolyzed, proteases 
can be divided into exopeptidases, which cleave the N- 
or C-terminal peptide bond, and endopeptidases, which 
cleave the internal peptide bond (Boon et al. 2020; Mat -
kawala et  al. 2021). Depending on the optimal pH for 
their action, they can be classified as alkaline, acidic, or 
neutral proteases (Matkawala et  al. 2021). Additionally, 
they can be divided into serine proteases, sulfhydryl pro -
teases, metalloproteases, and acid proteases, according 
to the group in which they exert their hydrolytic action 
(Matkawala et  al. 2021). Remarkably, certain proteases 
demonstrate high selectivity by selectively hydrolyz -
ing specific peptide bonds in protein substrates. Micro -
organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and archaea, have 
the ability to secrete various types of proteases (Agui -
lar and Sato 2018; Razzaq et al. 2019). For example, the 
bacterium Bacillus cereus is known to secrete alkaline 
proteases (Orhan et  al. 2005), while the fungus Asper -
gillus niger is capable of secreting acidic proteases (Wei 
et  al. 2023). These microbial-derived proteases possess 
advantageous characteristics, including high efficiency, 
stability, and ease of purification. Consequently, they are 
widely employed in various industries such as food, feed, pharmaceutical, and leather processing (Chanalia et  al. 
2011; Matkawala et al. 2021; Rao et al. 1998).
Due to their own variability, microorganisms may be 
able to produce proteases that are adapted to different 
pH values, temperatures, pressures, and other indus -
trial requirements (Naveed et al. 2021). In some specific 
environments (such as high salt), common proteases 
tend to lose their activity, which limits their applica -
tion. Salt-tolerant proteases (STPs) are known for their 
high salt tolerance, and are able to withstand concentra -
tions of approximately 3.0 M NaCl or higher (Gao et al. 
2019, 2018). They are often found in organisms adapted 
to high-salt environments. STPs are more promising 
for industrial applications due to their higher salt tol -
erance, wider adaptability, and more efficient catalytic 
ability under extreme conditions compared to common 
proteases. In the food processing industry, STPs can be 
used in high-salt foods, such as soy sauce, curd, shrimp 
paste, and sausages (Gao et al. 2019, 2018; Naveed et al. 
2021). Their contribution lies in their ability to hydrolyze 
proteins, thereby improving the taste, flavor, and over -
all quality of such foods. In the environmental industry, 
STPs can help improve water quality by breaking down 
complex organic compounds in industrial wastewater 
into simpler, more easily removable forms (Anh et  al. 
2021; Sivaprakasam et  al. 2011). In addition, STPs have Page 3 of 23
 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
 
shown potential as antifungal agents in agriculture, food 
production, and biotechnology (Essghaier et  al. 2009). 
They have also been used in detergent formulations for 
the effective removal of blood, egg, grass, and ketchup 
stains (Mokashe et al. 2017). Given their distinctive func -
tional properties and potential commercial value, STPs 
have attracted considerable attention from researchers.
In recent years, there has been an increasing number 
of studies on microbial-derived STPs. These studies have 
focused on screening or identifying novel salt-tolerant 
microorganisms from different ecological environments 
using various modern techniques to uncover novel STPs 
with superior properties (Gao et al. 2020; Nishikawa et al. 
2022; Sun et al. 2020; Takenaka et al. 2022). The catalytic 
mechanisms of STPs have been intensively studied using 
molecular biology and protein chemistry techniques to 
reveal their unique catalytic properties in high-salt envi -
ronments (Gao et  al. 2019). Using protein modification 
and computer-aided simulation techniques, research -
ers have successfully modified protease molecules to 
enhance the salt tolerance of the enzyme itself (Senba 
et al. 2023; Takenaka et al. 2022; Takita et al. 2008). Novel 
STP preparations have been developed and are being 
tested for applications in biopharmaceuticals, food pro -
cessing, environmental treatment, and other fields (Fu 
et al. 2008; Hao et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2019). In addition, 
optimizing the growth conditions of enzyme-producing 
microorganisms and developing effective isolation and 
purification protocols are important research directions 
for researchers to obtain novel STPs with potential func -
tional value and capable of meeting industrial demands 
(Setyorini et al. 2006; Sivaprakasam et al. 2011; Vidyasa -
gar et  al. 2007). However, despite numerous scientific 
reports on the discovery of novel STPs, improvement in 
STP activity and yield, exploration of STP mechanisms, 
and expansion of commercial applications (An et al. 2023; 
Banerjee and Ray 2017; Karan et al. 2012; Mokashe et al. 
2018), a systematic review of microbial-derived STPs 
and their application to traditional high-salt soy-based 
fermented foods is notably absent. This comprehensive 
review introduces the STP-producing microbial species 
and their selection methods, and summarizes and ana -
lyzes the salt tolerance mechanisms of the microorgan -
isms. It also presents different methods for the isolation 
and purification of STPs and discusses the mechanisms 
underlying their salt tolerance. In addition, it highlights 
the significant contribution of modern biotechnology in 
enhancing salt tolerance in STPs. Importantly, this review 
emphasizes the wide range of applications of STPs in 
high-salt traditional soybean fermented foods and offers 
insights into the future development of microbial-derived 
STPs. By consolidating this information, this review aims 
to provide a valuable resource for researchers to identify gaps in knowledge concerning the process of isolating 
and purifying microbial-derived STPs, improving their 
performance, and exploring their applications in tradi -
tional fermented foods.
Study on microorganisms producing STPs
Microorganisms producing STPs
Microorganisms producing STPs primarily include bac -
teria, fungi, and some archaea. Table  1 collects infor -
mation on some microbial-derived STPs reported since 
2015. Notably, the strains have been isolated from vari -
ous high-salt environments such as saline soils, seawa -
ter, lakes, and marine sediments, and used in various 
industries (Daoud et  al. 2018; Flores-Santos et  al. 2020; 
Foophow et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2020). STPs produced by 
different microorganisms differ not only in salt tolerance, 
but also in structure and enzymatic properties such as 
the optimum temperature, pH, and metal ion inhibition. 
These differences in structure and properties directly 
influence the range of industrial applications for these 
STPs (Chung et  al. 2022; Falkenberg et  al. 2022; Yang 
et al. 2020). The alkaline protease from the halotolerant 
alkaliphilic Bacillus  sp. strain NPST-AK15 can remain sta -
ble in NaCl up to 20% (w/v). The optimum pH and tem -
perature for the enzyme are 10.5 and 60 °C, respectively. 
When pre-incubated with some commercial detergents 
at 40 °C for 1 h, it retains the initial activity of 75–100%. 
These results suggest that it may play a significant role in 
commercial detergents (Ibrahim et  al. 2015a). Similarly, 
alkaline proteases used in detergent formulations have 
been reported to be active at concentrations up to 4  M 
NaCl, with enhanced activity in the presence of  CaCl2, 
KCl, and  MnCl2 (Mokashe et  al. 2017). However, the 
optimum pH and temperature are 8.5 and 55 °C, respec -
tively, which are lower than those of the alkaline protease 
from Bacillus  sp. strain NPST-AK15. Most of the reported 
STPs from microorganisms are alkaline proteases, while 
reports of salt-tolerant neutral proteases and acid pro -
teases are few (Table  1). The salt-tolerant neutral pro -
tease from Aspergillus oryzae CICIM F0899 has shown 
high salt tolerance in 18% NaCl and can maintain 72% of 
its initial activity after 14 days (Wang et al. 2013). It has 
promising applications in soy sauce production. The acid 
protease from Rhodotorula mucilaginosa L7 can main -
tain 60% activity in 3.5  M NaCl concentration, and its 
optimum pH and temperature are 5.0 and 50 °C, respec -
tively (Lario et al. 2015). This protease may lead to poten -
tial biotechnological applications.

extensively studied for their ability to produce STPs. 
These bacteria include a wide variety of genera, such as 
Bacillus , Halophilus, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Halococ -
cus, Salinobacterium , Nocardia , and Salipaludibacillus  
(Lee et al. 2010). Among these, Bacillus  stands out as an 
important source of STPs, and a large number of puri -
fied and characterized STPs originate from this genus 
(Ibrahim et  al. 2015b). A new halotolerant alkaliphilic 
strain of Bacillus , specifically Bacillus  sp. strain NPST-
AK15, has been isolated from a high-salt lake (Ibrahim 
et al. 2015b). This strain has shown potential to produce 
an extracellular serine protease, which further expands 
the range of STP species available for study and appli -
cation. A recently discovered extracellular haloprotease 
has been successfully isolated and purified from Bacillus 
licheniformis KB111 (Foophow et  al. 2022). With their 
distinctive enzymatic properties, these proteases have 
found a wide range of applications in diverse industries 
including detergents, leather production, food process -
ing, medicine, textiles, and environmental protection. For 
instance, the alkaline serine protease isolated and puri -
fied from Bacillus velezensis  SW5 exhibits remarkable 
fibrinolytic activity, which is expected to achieve efficient 
fibrin hydrolysis in medical treatment (Yang et al. 2020). 
Additionally, a novel halogen- and heat-resistant alka -
line protease derived from Bacillus agaradhaerens strain 
AK-R has been purified, which may have potential appli -
cability in laundry and pharmaceutical operations due 
to its exceptional tolerance to temperature, pH, and salt 
concentration (Ibrahim et al. 2016).
Fungi represent a significant source of STPs, with 
notable species including A. niger, A. oryzae, Aspergillus reticularis, Penicillium citrus, and Penicillium nalgio -
vense (Foophow et  al. 2022; Lee et  al. 2010). Many of 
these fungus-derived STPs have demonstrated potential 
applications in traditional high-salt fermented foods, 
such as soy sauce, shrimp paste, and fish paste. One 
promising example is the halotolerant alkaline serine 
protease derived from Penicillium citrinum YL-1, which 
exhibits superior salt tolerance compared to proteases 
from other bacteria known for their high salt tolerance. 
This characteristic makes it a promising candidate for 
the hydrolysis of fish protein during fish sauce fermen -
tation (Xie et al. 2016). A. oryzae 3.042, a strain isolated 
from traditional high-salt foods, has been found to pro -
duce not only alkaline proteases (Gao et al. 2019) but also 
salt-tolerant neutral protease (Wang et  al. 2013), acid 
protease (Lee et al. 2010), and aspartate aminopeptidase 
(Gao et al. 2018). These enzymes play a crucial role in the 
utilization of fermented food proteins and the produc -
tion of flavor compounds. Similarly, the fungus A. niger, 
capable of producing these enzymes simultaneously, has 
been employed in high-salt traditional foods alongside A. 
oryzae to enhance product quality and flavor (Leng and 
Xu 2011; Wahab and Ahmed 2018; Wang et al. 2021c ).
Archaea has emerged as a novel and promising source 
of STPs. With increasing research on archaea, it has been 
discovered that many of these microorganisms can pro -
duce STPs. These archaea include Haloarcula, Halococ -
cus, and others (Abanoz et al. 2017; Gaonkar and Furtado 
2020; Hou et al. 2021). Haloarcula sp.  TG1, isolated from 
salt mines and salt lakes, has been found to produce 
proteases with maximum activity at pH 4.0, 50  °C, and 
4  M NaCl (Abanoz et  al. 2017). Moreover, Halococcus Table 1 (continued)

agarilyticus  GUGFAWS-3, isolated from a marine white 
sponge, can produce two halo-extremozymes: pro -
tease and lipase. The optimal activity of the protease is 
pH 7.0, 70  °C, and 3  M NaCl. Notably, this represents 
the first report of halophilic neutral protease produc -
tion within the Halococcus genus (Gaonkar and Furtado 
2020). Although the production of STPs in archaea has 
been less extensively studied than in other microorgan -
isms, the investigation of extracellular proteases in salt-
tolerant archaea holds great potential to expand the field 
of protease applications and contribute to the exploration 
of novel STPs.
Screening methods for microorganisms producing STPs
Traditional methods for selecting STP-producing micro -
organisms rely primarily on the specific microbial pro -
duction environment. These environments include highly 
saline habitats such as oceans, salt lakes, salt farms, saline 
soils, and salt-containing foods. Isolation of salt-toler -
ant microorganisms from these environments requires 
many steps such as sample collection, isolation of strains, 
morphological characteristics and molecular sequence 
identification of strains (Abanoz et  al. 2017). To obtain 
excellent STP-producing strains, additional steps such as 
optimizing enzyme production conditions and evaluating 
the enzyme production capacity of the microorganism 
based on the enzyme activity index have been imple -
mented (Wahab and Ahmed 2018; Zhang et  al. 2023). 
While microorganisms obtained through conventional 
screening methods exhibit high salt tolerance and sta -
ble enzyme production capacity, limitations such as low 
screening efficiency and time consumption may restrict 
their widespread application.
In order to obtain organisms with enhanced pro -
tease production capacity, various methods have been 
employed to screen for strains exhibiting high levels 
of STP production, including UV mutagenesis, chemi -
cal reagent mutagenesis, room-temperature plasma 
mutagenesis, and genetic engineering. For example, by 
mutagenesis of A. oryzae 3.042 at room temperature 
and atmospheric pressure, a mutant strain, designated 
H8, has been obtained with significant activity of neu -
tral protease, alkaline protease, and aspartyl aminopepti -
dase (Gao et  al. 2020). The incorporation of this strain 
in soy sauce fermentation processes has led to signifi -
cant improvements in peptide and amino acid content. 
The serine protease gene isp  from Bacillus  sp.  LCB10 
has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using 
genetic engineering techniques. The resulting serine 
protease demonstrates high tolerance to NaCl, exhib -
iting stable activity in the presence of 1–5% NaCl and 
retaining 86% of its activity in the presence of 7% NaCl 
(Hou et  al. 2019). Additionally, the gene encoding the extracellular protease, sptA, has been cloned from the 
halophilic archaeon Natrinema sp. J7 and successfully 
expressed in Haloferax volcanii WFD11 (Shi et al. 2006). 
The resultant recombinant enzyme exhibits remark -
able stability, retaining activity even in the presence of 
2.5  M NaCl at 50  °C and pH 8.0. While these methods 
significantly enhance the likelihood of attaining excellent 
protease-producing strains, certain challenges such as 
screening limitations and demanding technical require -
ments are also encountered. Screening processes rely -
ing on wild-type strains may suffer from screening blind 
spots and involve high workloads.
In nature, microorganisms are categorized as either 
culturable and unculturable, especially those living in 
extreme environments, which may produce STPs with 
special structures and functions (Wang et al. 2021a). To 
increase the likelihood of discovering novel secondary 
metabolites even from unculturable microorganisms, 
metagenomics is employed to analyze the functional 
potential of DNA extracted from environmental samples. 
For instance, a metagenomic library has been constructed 
from the DNA of the Chumathang hot spring sediment, 
leading to the identification of heat-resistant, basophilic, 
and oxidative-stable serine proteases (Singh et al. 2015). 
Using a metagenomic screening approach, another serine 
protease gene has been cloned from a saline habitat and 
is active in saline conditions (Purohit and Singh 2013). 
A novel thermostable serine protease has been obtained 
from a metagenomic library derived from marine sedi -
ments in the East China Sea, which not only shows good 
thermal activity and stability, but also has strong salt tol -
erance (40% residual activity when kept in 3  M NaCl) 
(Sun et  al. 2020). With the advancement of bioinfor -
matics, there has been a growing number of studies on 
integrated metagenomic approaches such as metagen -
omics and metaproteomics to assist in the screening of 
STP-producing microorganisms (Busche et al. 2018; Gar -
cia-Moyano et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022). Using metagen -
omics and peptidomics analysis, 138 umami peptides 
and 6 kinds of proteases from 35 microbial genera have 
been identified from traditional fish fermentation (Yang 
et al. 2022). The role of cellular proteases in Streptomy -
ces protein secretion has been identified by multi-omics 
and targeted approaches, providing the first multi-omics 
techniques effort to characterize the complex regulatory 
mechanisms of Streptomyces protein secretion (Busche 
et al. 2018). Multi-omics techniques can help scientists to 
fully understand the genetic, transcriptional, protein, and 
metabolic information of microorganisms, thereby aid -
ing microbial breeding and optimization (Aguiar-Pulido 
et  al. 2016; Ge et  al. 2021; Wu et  al. 2022). A process 
framework for screening STP-producing microorganisms 
using multi-omics techniques is shown in Fig.  1. Based Page 7 of 23

on gene, protein and enzyme activity, microorganisms 
capable of producing STPs can be rapidly screened from 
a large number of samples using modern bioinformatics 
techniques. In summary, the breeding of STP-producing 
microorganisms requires the combined use of physi -
cal, chemical, biological, and information technologies, 
as well as other technological means. In the future, it is 
worth discussing how these techniques can be used to 
quickly, accurately, and efficiently select microorganisms 
producing STPs.
Salt‑tolerant mechanisms of microorganisms
Microorganisms can adapt to a wide range of NaCl con -
centrations, and their NaCl tolerance may be far greater 
than that of any other organism (Vreeland 1987). Halo -
philic/halotolerant microorganisms that are able to 
hydrolyze proteins are an important source of STPs. 
Halophilic/halotolerant microorganisms are well adapted 
to higher salt concentrations, and the enzymes they pro -
duce must remain active in high-salinity environments 
(Mokashe et al. 2018). Several studies have been reported 
on the salt-tolerant mechanisms of microorganisms 
(Chen et  al. 2021; Kurt-Kizildogan et  al. 2017). Halo -
philic microorganisms prefer high-salt concentrations to 
survive and reproduce compared to halotolerant micro -
organisms, but this review does not strictly distinguish 
the salt-tolerant mechanisms between halophilic and 
halotolerant microorganisms. In general, these microor -
ganisms adapt to different salt concentrations through 
rejection, secretion, and intracellular accumulation, and 
these processes have been attributed to multiple mech -
anisms (Edbeib et  al. 2016; Vreeland 1987). Several salt 
tolerance mechanisms for some salt-tolerant bacteria are 
shown in Fig.  2. These salt-tolerant mechanisms are sum -
marized below.
Adaptive strategies employed by microorganisms for 
achieving salt tolerance involve the differential expres -
sion of gene regulatory proteins. Under the stress of 
a highly osmotic environment, these microorganisms 
regulate and orchestrate protein expression by up-regu -
lating, down-regulating, and replicating pertinent genes. 
Such proteins include membrane transporters, oxidative 
stress proteins, ferritin, as well as various enzymes, such 
as dehydrogenase, synthase, and salt-tolerant enzymes 
(Chen et al. 2021; Soppa 2006). A transcriptional analy -
sis of low- and high-salt genes in the extremely halophilic 
archaea Halolalama  sp. YKT1, isolated from a salt mine 
in Turkey, has revealed that 2149 genes are up-regulated 
and 1638 genes are down-regulated under high-salt con -
ditions (Kurt-Kizildogan et al. 2017). Notably, the upreg -
ulation of genes associated with membrane transporters, 
the CRISPR–Cas system, osmotic protection solutes, 
oxidative stress proteins, and iron metabolism is closely linked to salt tolerance. This suggests that salt-tolerant 
microorganisms can respond to and resist high-salt 
environments by up-regulating the genes encoding their 
transporters and transport systems, which is supported 
by similar reports (Zeng et  al. 2022). Up-regulation or 
expression of genes encoding STPs can improve the salt 
tolerance of cells and prevent the cells from being killed 
by salt. A salt stress-responsive cysteine protease gene 
from Salix matsudana has been cloned and expressed 
in E. coli, which leads to the enhancement of salt toler -
ance in E. coli (Zheng et al. 2018). By comparing the ser -
ine protease genes of the halotolerant cyanobacterium 
Halothece sp. PCC7418 and the freshwater cyanobac -
terium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, it has been 
shown that several serine protease genes of the halotol -
erant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC7418 were dras -
tically up-regulated under salt with high concentration 
but remained unchanged under salt with low concentra -
tion (Patipong et al. 2021). These results suggest that the 
genes encoding STPs may be associated with salt toler -
ance in microorganisms.
The adaptation strategy of salt on cell surfaces has also 
been suggested as one of the reasons for microbial salt 
tolerance (Mokashe et al. 2018). It has been shown that 
the fraction of anionic phospholipids in the cell mem -
brane of halophilic bacteria gradually increases with 
higher salinity levels, resulting in an additional mem -
brane surface charge that helps to maintain the hydra -
tion state of the plasma membrane (Mokashe et al. 2018). 
Compared with the changes in cell membrane composi -
tion of yeast tolerant to low and high salt concentrations, 
it has been found that changes in the composition of sat -
urated and unsaturated fatty acids in highly salt-tolerant 
yeast lead to a decrease in membrane permeability and 
mobility, which may contribute to salt tolerance (Qi et al. 
2014). Glycerol is commonly used as a microbial protec -
tion agent. Under high salt stress, engineered yeast can 
produce abundant glycerol and secrete it extracellularly. 
The production of microbial extracellular polysaccha -
rides (EPS) can modify the physical and chemical prop -
erties of the membrane, including surface charge and 
hydrophobicity, facilitating the active transport and diffu -
sion of microorganisms and ultimately enhancing salt tol -
erance. Current stimulation can promote the production 
of low molecular weight EPS, which is beneficial for the 
salt tolerance of microorganisms (Feng et al. 2022). Strain 
JZ-GX1 can improve its salt tolerance by secreting large 
amounts of EPS, which was secreted at 6983.9 mg/L at a 
high salt concentration of 60% (Li et al. 2021a). Further -
more, the addition of exogenous factors such as betaine 
(Hu et al. 2020a), acyl homoserine lactone (Li et al. 2019), 
and signal molecule autoinducer-2 (Gu et  al. 2021) has Page 9 of 23
 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
 
been demonstrated to stimulate EPS production and bio -
film formation, promoting salt tolerance in cells.
The salt-in strategy is one of the salt-tolerant strategies 
of microorganisms. This is a process in which inorganic 
salts (such as sodium and potassium ions) accumulate in 
the cytoplasmic fluid and involves the entry and exit of 
metal cations/H+ into the cell through membrane pro -
teins (Mokashe et al. 2018). Salt-tolerant microorganisms 
can respond to salt stress by up-regulating the  Na+/H+ 
antiporter subunit mnhA-G (Zeng et al. 2022). The  Na+/
H+ antiporter plays an important role in maintaining cel -
lular pH and cation homeostasis. Microorganisms can 
expel excess  Na+ from cells driven by ATP (Edbeib et al. 
2016). Several anti-transporter genes have been reported 
(Fujisawa et al. 2005). A CPD photolytic gene, PnPHR1, 
has been isolated from the Antarctic moss, Pohlia nutans 
(Wang et  al. 2021b). The gene enhances the salt toler -
ance of the microbe by increasing the expression of a 
high-affinity potassium transporter gene and a tono -
plast-bound  Na+/H+ antiporter. In addition, salt-tolerant 
microorganisms can temporarily increase their cytoplas -
mic  K+ content and accumulate osmotic fluid as a more 
persistent stress response to prevent water loss and sur -
vive osmotic and ionic stress (Zheng et al. 2021). Most  K+ 
transporters are unidirectional, and osmotic protection 
of  K+ entry into cells can only be achieved by balancing 
the negative charge of other small molecules (Lefebvre 
and Moletta 2006). Several systems for maintaining  K+ 
homeostasis in cells have been reported. These systems, 
which maintain cell stability, play different roles in differ -
ent media and transport processes of  K+ concentration 
(Lefebvre and Moletta 2006).
The accumulation of compatible solutes is one of the 
most common salt tolerance mechanisms of microorgan -
isms. In response to a high salt environment, microorgan -
isms accumulate intracellular small molecule substances 
through intracellular synthesis or direct acquisition from 
the surrounding media to maintain cellular osmotic equi -
librium. These substances are highly water-soluble mol -
ecules, known as ’compatible solutes’ , including glycerol, 
sugars, polyols, betaine, ectoine, hydroxyectoine, proline, 
lysine, and glycine (Zhang et al. 2022d). Different micro -
organisms may use one or more different compatible 
solutes. The salt stress of marine myxobacteria, Plesio -
cystis pacifica SIR-1 and Enhygromyxa salina SWB007, 
shows that the former only depends on the accumula -
tion of amino acids, while the latter uses hydroxyectoine 
as the main compatible solute in addition to betaine 
(Moghaddam et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2022d). The genetic 
code also confirms that only the latter has the biosynthe -
sis capacity of betaine, ectoine, and hydroxyectoine. In 
addition, microorganisms using the intracellular small 
molecule compatible solute accumulation strategy are generally more flexible and can more easily adapt to pres -
sure or salinity-induced mutation than those that use a 
salt solution strategy (Kurt-Kizildogan et al. 2017). There 
may be different mechanisms of salt tolerance between 
halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms. Researchers 
have discovered that strict halophilic bacteria employ the 
salt-in and accumulation of compatible solutes strategies 
for osmoregulation under high salt conditions. In con -
trast, halotolerant bacteria utilize the compatible solute 
accumulation strategy rather than the salt-in strategy to 
resist salt stress (Vaidya et al. 2018).
Study on microbial‑derived STPs
Isolation and purification of STPs
Separation and purification of STPs is a complex pro -
cess. After obtaining suitable enzyme-producing condi -
tions and selecting suitable separation and purification 
methods, microbial cells need to be cultured to obtain 
large quantities of the enzyme. Some information on the 
purification and separation of microbial-derived STPs 
and their enzymatic properties is collected in Table  2. 
The steps involved in the isolation and purification of 
proteases are slightly different due to the different posi -
tions of proteases in the cell. For intracellular proteases, 
microbial cells need to be physically or chemically bro -
ken down to release intracellular proteases. Using the 
above method, a large number of crude enzymes have 
been obtained (Hou et  al. 2019). For extracellular pro -
teases, culture media are usually collected directly and 
crude enzyme solutions are obtained by concentration 
and centrifugation (Tanasupawat et al. 2011). Salting-out, 
dialysis, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration 
chromatography are often used to enrich and purify pro -
teases. The neutral protease with high salt tolerance from 
A. oryzae CICIM F0899 has been purified by ammonium 
sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and 
gel filtration chromatography (Wang et  al. 2013). The 
total recovery of the enzyme is 2%, and the optimum pH 
value and temperature are 7.0–9.0 and 50  °C, respec -
tively. The protease shows high salt tolerance in 18% 
NaCl, maintaining 72% of its initial activity after 14 days. 
Similarly, a salt-tolerant alkaline protease has been iso -
lated and purified from the culture medium of A. ory -
zae 3.042 by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, 
and gel filtration chromatography (Gao et al. 2019). The 
optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme are 9.0 and 
40 °C, respectively. After incubation with 3.0 M NaCl for 
7 days, the relative enzyme activity remained above 20%. 
The same method has been used for the separation and 
purification of the proteases produced by microorgan -
isms in certain special habitats, such as the ocean, salt 
farms, and saline-alkali soils. Halophilic neutral proteases 
from H. agarilyticus GUGFAWS-3 have been isolated and Page 10 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82

Multiple strategies have been reported for the purifi -
cation of microbial proteases, each with a different role 
(Banerjee and Ray 2017). High-purity proteases can be 
obtained using these methods or by combining them 
appropriately. Two alkaline proteases of Haloalkaliphi -
lic bacterium D-15–9 and Oceanobacillus onchorynchii 
Mi-10-54, purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation 
and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, have a 
certain salt tolerance and temperature tolerance, and 
the latter is more thermostable (Raval et  al. 2022). The 
halophilic protease Pph_Pro1, cloned from Pseudoaltero -
monas phenolica, has been purified by an osmotic shock 
procedure and immobilized metal affinity chromatog -
raphy (Johnson et  al. 2018). The purified enzyme has 
an activity of 0.44 U/mg and exhibits halophilic, alkalo -
philic, and thermally stable properties. An extracellular 
protease HlyA from the extremely halophilic archaeon 
Halococcus salifodinae has been isolated and purified by 
affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatog -
raphy (Hou et  al. 2021). Its activity is best at 45  °C, pH 
9.0, and 1.5–2 M NaCl. It retains the maximum activity 
of > 75% at a wide range of NaCl concentrations from 0.5 
to 4.0 M. With the development of science and technol -
ogy, label-assisted protein purification technology has 
gradually become the preferred method for scientific research and large-scale industrial demand (Gomari et al. 
2020). Employing fusion proteins can help to save time 
and cost, and they can help to achieve high-throughput 
purification of the protein. In practice, high-purity STPs 
are important due to their high stability and efficiency, 
thus improving the effectiveness of their applications. 
Therefore, the isolation and purification of STPs is one of 
the most important aspects in the study of STPs, and is of 
great importance in the study of their biochemical prop -
erties and applications.
Salt‑tolerant mechanisms of STPs
High salt concentrations severely affect the solubility, 
binding, stability, crystallization, and interaction with 
other substances or proteins, and have a significant 
impact on the structure and function of proteins (Karan 
et  al. 2012). The salt tolerance mechanism of proteases 
has been studied more intensively with intensive research 
conducted in the biological sciences. The salt-tolerant 
mechanisms of STPs are related to their own secondary 
structure (low isoelectric point, the flexible loop regions, 
and ordered structures), surface acidic amino acids, 
local charge changes, salt bridge formation, and internal 
hydrophobic amino acid residues (formation of hydration 
layer). Although halotolerant and halophilic proteases 
have different salt dependence, this review does not make 
a strict distinction between halotolerant and halophilic 
proteases. Various factors of salt stability of STPs are 
shown in Fig.  3. STPs adapt to high salt environments by 
Fig. 3 Several mechanisms of salt stability of STPsPage 13 of 23
 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
 
following aspects to maintain their catalytic activity and 
stability.
The ordered secondary structure of proteases (helix, 
strand, and steering), the structure of the flexible loop 
region, and the existing form of the protein structure may 
affect the stability of STPs (Gromiha et  al. 1999; Karan 
et al. 2012). The alpha-helix and beta-strand contents of 
salt-tolerant acid protease and salt-tolerant neutral pro -
tease have been compared (Gao et al. 2018). The results 
show that the alpha-helix and beta-strand contents of 
the former are higher than those of the latter, and that 
the former has a more stable structure. However, a com -
parison between alkaline proteases and neutral proteases 
shows that the more stable spatial structure of the for -
mer may be due to its higher amount of alpha-helix and 
beta-strand, but the former has fewer loop regions than 
the latter (Gao et al. 2019). The ordered structure is not 
only related to hydrophobicity, but is also influenced by 
hydrogen bonds and other interactions (Gromiha et  al. 
1999). Due to their high flexibility, loops in the protein 
are prone to expansion and instability under adverse 
external conditions (Ahmad et  al. 2012). The instability 
of loops is mainly due to the interaction between internal 
residues and the interaction between loop residues and 
molecules in solution (Vieille and Zeikus 2001). At room 
temperature, the interaction between  Na+ and the loop 
residues is weaker than that of the internal residues (Cai 
et al. 2022). Some enzymes exist as dimers or tetramers 
at high salt concentrations, but dissociate into monomers 
with the decrease of salt concentration, thus losing their 
activity, such as halophilic malate dehydrogenase (Ebel 
et al. 1999) and isocitrate dehydrogenase from the halo -
philic archaea Haloferax volcanii (Madern et al. 2004).
The large amount of acidic amino acids on the pro -
tein surface helps bind many water molecules and metal 
ions, increasing the hydration of the protein, thus form -
ing a hydration shell or network. This prevents the pro -
tein from aggregating at high salt concentrations, thus 
maintaining protease activity (Cai et  al. 2022; Fukuchi 
et al. 2003; Takenaka et al. 2022). In contrast to homolo -
gous non-halophilic proteins, halophilic enzymes typi -
cally contain a relatively high proportion of acidic amino 
acids, including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, ser -
ine, threonine, and valine (Mokashe et al. 2018). Crystal 
structure analysis of glucose dehydrogenase from the 
extremely halophilic archaea Haloferax mediterranei 
has shown a predominantly acidic surface, contribut -
ing to the halophilic nature of the enzyme (Britton et al. 
2006). This finding is further supported by the analysis 
of the three-dimensional structure of halophilic malate 
dehydrogenase and its non-halophilic homologues from 
the archaea Haloarcula marismortui (Dym et  al. 1995). 
Comparison of the amino acid compositions in the whole genomes of halophilic archaea, non-halophilic meso -
phytic bacteria, and thermophilic bacteria shows that the 
surface of halophilic proteases contains a significantly 
higher proportion of acidic amino acids compared to the 
inner region (Fukuchi et  al. 2003). These acidic amino 
acids account for up to 20–23% of individual proteins and 
play an important role in the salt stability of proteases 
(Karan et al. 2012). It has been observed that modifying 
the amino acid composition on the protein surface can 
alter the salt dependence of a protein, facilitating cross-
over between salt-tolerant and non-salt-tolerant proteins 
(Tadeo et al. 2009).
Hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids on the pro -
tein surface also affect the salt-adapted stability of STPs. 
Hydrophilic proteins have a lower abundance of hydro -
phobic side chains on their surface compared to non-
hydrophilic proteins (Karan et  al. 2012). The increase 
in the number of hydrophilic amino acids compared to 
hydrophobic amino acids on the protein surface is ben -
eficial for the stability of STPs (Mokashe et  al. 2018). 
A possible explanation for this observation is that the 
reduction in hydrophobic amino acid content and the 
corresponding increase in hydrophilic amino acid con -
tent facilitates the binding of metal ions to the protease 
surface charges, forming hydration shells or networks. 
Additionally, smaller hydrophobic amino acids such as 
glycine, alanine, and valine show an adaptive mechanism 
in halophilic enzymes, in contrast to larger hydrophobic 
counterparts (Mokashe et al. 2018).
The salt adaptation of STPs is influenced by the nega -
tive charge on the surface or localized surface of the 
STPs. For the most part, the effect of salt on protein sta -
bility is independent of the total charge of the protein 
(Karan et al. 2012). The highly negatively charged surface 
of proteases is a molecular marker of salt adaptation (Hu 
et al. 2022). The formation of negative charge on the sur -
face of these enzymes is mainly due to the presence of 
negatively charged amino acids on the surface (Promchai 
et al. 2018). It has been suggested that the highly negative 
surface charge of halophilic proteins makes them more 
soluble and flexible at high salt concentrations, whereas 
non-halophilic proteins tend to aggregate and harden 
under these conditions (Ortega et  al. 2011). In fact, the 
negative charge is shielded by more salt, which further 
prevents the expansion of the protein and maintains the 
solubility of the protein. Effective hydration and pro -
duction of ion-pair networks stabilize the structure and 
activity of enzymes (Mokashe et al. 2018; Promchai et al. 
2018). This result has also been confirmed for halophilic 
alpha-amylase (Hu et  al. 2022). These suggest that salt 
tolerance can be improved by modifying the local charge 
on the protein surface (Takenaka et al. 2022).Page 14 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
The formation of salt bridges also contributes to the salt 
tolerance of STPs. The salt bridge refers to the ionic bond 
between two amino acid residues with opposite charges. 
In high-salinity environments, the polar groups of pro -
tein molecules bind to ions to form salt bridges, which 
not only play an important role in protein folding, struc -
ture and oligomerization, but also enhance the stability 
of protein molecules (Dym et al. 1995). By comparing the 
halophilic malate dehydrogenase with its non-halophilic 
homologue in the archaea Haloarcula marismortui, 
researchers have found that the halophilic enzyme con -
tains more salt bridges and has a higher concentration of 
surface acidic residues. This difference may explain why 
the halophilic enzyme is more tolerant to salt (Dym et al. 
1995). Molecular dynamics simulations of endoglucanase 
from A. niger have revealed the formation of salt bridges 
between charged residues and  Na+ and  Cl− ions. These 
salt bridges affect the activity of the loop and the stability 
of the pocket, thus giving the enzyme salt tolerance and 
strong thermal stability in high-salt environments (Cai 
et  al. 2022). Salt bridges can also form between acidic 
residues and specific alkaline residues on the hydration 
surface, which enhance the ’rigidity’ of the enzyme at 
high salinity and protect the enzyme from salt ions (Oren 
and Mana 2002).
Internal hydrophobic amino acids of STPs are also 
related to their own salt adaptability. Studies have shown 
that the hydrophobicity of internal amino acid residues of 
proteins is strongly related to the stability of the internal 
structure (Gromiha et  al. 1999). The greater hydropho -
bicity of these internal amino acid residues is benefi -
cial for maintaining the internal stability of the protein. 
One possible explanation for the greater stability of the 
alkaline protease from A. oryzae compared to the neu -
tral protease is that the alkaline protease has a higher 
molar ratio of hydrophobic amino acid residues (such as 
alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and 
methionine) than the neutral protease (Gao et al. 2019). 
However, proteins responding to high salt environments 
often exhibit low levels of hydrophobic and lysine resi -
dues (Ortega et  al. 2011). Due to the tendency of large 
hydrophobic residues to form helixes, a significant 
reduction in the number of these residues may lead to 
increased flexibility, which may be a factor in salt adapta -
tion (Hu et al. 2022; Paul et al. 2008).
As previously discussed, ordered secondary structures, 
high surface acidic amino acid content, increased sur -
face negative charge, changes in internal hydrophobicity, 
and the formation and enrichment of salt bridges seem 
to be general strategies to improve the salt adaptation 
of STPs in high salt concentration conditions (Fig.  3). 
However, these mechanisms may not be universal (Brit -
ton et al. 1998), and future studies should further explore the salt-tolerant mechanism of STPs. For some STPs, the 
presence of salt is essential to restore their active struc -
tural conformations (Mevarech et al. 2000). These STPs 
require the presence of high salt concentrations to exhibit 
good solubility, stability, and catalytic activity, indicat -
ing their dependence on salt (Enache and Kamekura 
2010; González-Hernández and Peña 2002; Mokashe 
et  al. 2018). Meanwhile, some STPs do not depend on 
the presence of salt, but their activity and stability may 
be inhibited under high-salt conditions (Jothi Basu et al. 
2015). Interestingly, due to the employment of multiple 
salt-adaptation strategies, some STPs not only tolerate or 
require high salt concentrations. They also maintain their 
active conformation and good stability in a variety of 
organic solvents and cataclysmic reagents (Mokashe et al. 
2018; Sinha and Khare 2014). The multiple salt adapta -
tion strategy allows STPs to maintain stability and better 
catalytic activity at high salt concentrations compared 
to common proteases. Under harsh conditions (such as 
salt, organic solvents, oxidants, and bleach), the activ -
ity of common proteases is inhibited or even denatured, 
resulting in incomplete hydrolysis of substrate proteins 
and limited production of small molecule peptides and 
amino acids (Rodriguez-Rios et al. 2022; Sana et al. 2006). 
However, under the same conditions, STPs exhibit supe -
rior stability and catalytic properties, allowing them to 
hydrolyze substrate proteins into abundant peptides and 
small amino acids (Hou et al. 2020; Mokashe et al. 2018). 
Therefore, due to their outstanding performance under 
harsh conditions, STPs are a top consideration for appli -
cations in the modern biotechnology industry (Liu et al. 
2023; Sana et al. 2006).
Using modern biotechnology to improve the salt tolerance 
of proteases
While STP-producing microorganisms or new STPs 
have been discovered from natural environments using 
various screening techniques, the utilization of proteases 
should not only focus on the most effective approach to 
isolate potential enzymes from microorganisms or natu -
ral environments, but also consider modifying enzymes 
through available biotechnology methods to enhance 
their properties. Various biotechnology techniques have 
been reported to improve the properties of STPs, such as 
genetic engineering techniques (Hou et al. 2019), immo -
bilization techniques (Dong et  al. 2022), and computer-
aided design techniques (Takenaka et  al. 2022). These 
techniques play an important role in improving the activ -
ity and stability of enzymes.
Genetic engineering techniques are known to transfer 
target genes encoding STPs into recipient cells, thereby 
enabling over-expression of enzymes and enhancing 
enzyme activity. For example, the serine protease gene isp Page 15 of 23
 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
 
of salt-tolerant Bacillus  sp.  LCB10 has been expressed in 
E. coli, leading to highly salt-tolerant proteases (Hou et al. 
2019). The enzyme maintains 86% activity in the presence 
of 7% NaCl. With the development of bioinformatics, 
genetic engineering techniques are often combined with 
multi-omics techniques to reveal the salt tolerance mech -
anisms of STPs and to identify the coding and regulatory 
genes of microbial STPs. This strategy can increase the 
chances of discovering new enzymes and enzymes with 
special functions. These genes are re-fused, recombined, 
and induced to be expressed in E. coli, Bacillus , and other 
microorganisms to improve enzyme production and tol -
erance. For instance, coding genes from the peptidase 
S8A subfamily, which has a high ability to hydrolyze pro -
teins, have been screened from the krill metagenomic 
library using metagenomic techniques (Sun et al. 2020). 
Subsequently, these genes are expressed in E. coli, result -
ing in the generation of proteases with remarkable salt 
tolerance. These proteases retain 40% of their residual 
activity when stored in 3  M NaCl, as demonstrated in 
previous studies (Purohit and Singh 2013). These STPs 
have great potential for various industrial applications.
Enzyme immobilization techniques involve immo -
bilizing enzymes on carriers (such as gel, resin, fiber, 
and metal) to form immobilized catalysts (Ibra -
him et  al. 2021; Motamedi et  al. 2021; Rahman et  al. 
2016). Adsorption, covalent binding, cross-linking, 
and entrapment are the four main methods of enzyme 
immobilization (Dong et  al. 2022; Motamedi et  al. 
2021). These methods not only enhance the catalytic 
efficiency of the enzyme, facilitating its recovery and 
reuse, but also enhance its activity and stability (Dong 
et al. 2022). To improve protease stability, extracellular 
STPs from Bacillus  sp. DL-1 have been immobilized 
by diatomite adsorption and can retain approximately 
35.8% of their activity after six repetitions (Dong et al. 
2022). In contrast to free proteases, the alkaline pro -
tease from Salipaludibacillus agaradhaerens immo -
bilized on mesoporous core–shell nanoparticles not 
only maintains high enzyme activity at high tempera -
tures and low pH, but has been shown to significantly 
improve enzyme stability against high concentrations 
of NaCl, organic solvents, surfactants, and commer -
cial detergents (Ibrahim et  al. 2021). However, some 
enzymes may decrease or lose activity after immo -
bilization using these conventional immobilization 
techniques due to mass transfer limitations and unfa -
vorable conformations between the enzyme and sub -
strate (Altinkaynak et  al. 2016; Hanefeld et  al. 2013). 
Using a hybrid nanoflower technique, enzymes can be 
immobilized by employing proteases and metal ions 
as organic and inorganic components. This method is highly effective in enhancing the catalytic activity and 
stability of enzymes, even under harsh conditions such 
as high salt concentrations, extreme pH levels, and 
temperature changes (Altinkaynak et  al. 2016). This 
new immobilization technique has been applied to pro -
teases, including trypsin (Lin et al. 2014), papain (Liang 
et al. 2015), and chymotrypsin (Yin et al. 2015). These 
cases suggest that these techniques for immobilizing 
enzymes can be used as potential future approaches for 
improving the salt tolerance of proteases.
With the development of bioinformatics and the 
continuous improvement of biological databases (such 
as protein information resource and protein sequence 
database), the use of computer-aided rational design 
of enzyme molecules has gradually gained favor with 
researchers (Ashraf et  al. 2019; Xi et  al. 2022; Zhang 
et  al. 2022c ). These methods mainly include directed 
evolution, rational design, and ab initio design (Ashraf 
et al. 2019). These methods can modify the amino acid 
sequence (e.g., the surface charge) of proteins by point 
mutations, insertions, substitutions, and deletions, thus 
enabling engineered modifications of proteases and 
enhancing their salt tolerance. Previous studies have 
reported site-directed mutagenesis of eight site-specific 
mutations on the surface of moderately salt-tolerant 
serine proteases from Bacillus subtilis, yielding several 
mutants with substituted aspartic acid and arginine 
residues (Takenaka et al. 2022). The salt tolerance of the 
three mutants is 1.2 times higher than that of the wild 
type. Multiple substitutions of these amino acid resi -
dues may alter the ratio of negative to positive charges 
on the protease surface, thereby increasing the hydra -
tion and solubility of the protease surface at high salt 
concentrations, and improving the salt adaptation of 
the enzyme itself. Similar studies have also reported 
that seven amino acid residues of thermophilic pro -
teases are mutagenized into aspartic acid residues by 
site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a high frac -
tion of negative charges on the protein surface (Tak -
ita et al. 2008). The casein hydrolytic activity of six of 
the seven mutants is 17–19 times higher than that of 
the wild type when exposed to 4 M NaCl. In addition, 
directed evolution of random mutagenesis or rational 
design of site-directed mutagenesis has been employed 
to improve the thermal stability of proteases (Ashraf 
et al. 2019; Martinez et al. 2013; Zhao and Feng 2018). 
These results suggest that computer-aided design tech -
niques can be employed to analyze and predict the 
amino acid sequence and structural information of 
proteins, enabling rational modification of protease 
molecules. These modern biotechnological methods Page 16 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
can significantly improve the salt tolerance of STPs, 
thus providing a more reliable and efficient source of 
enzymes for industrial applications of STPs.
Examples of microbial‑derived STPs applied 
to high‑salt traditional soy‑fermented foods
Application in soy sauce fermentation
Soy sauce is one of the most popular and important con -
diments in East Asian cuisine, especially in China and 
Japan (Liu et  al. 2015). In general, there are two main 
steps in the brewing process of soy sauce, namely, koji 
making and moromi fermentation (Hu et al. 2020b). The 
purpose of koji-making is to enrich certain enzyme-pro -
ducing microorganisms to obtain a variety of enzymes 
(Zhang et  al. 2022b). The quality of koji determines the 
fermentation efficiency and quality of the soy sauce. The 
purpose of moromi fermentation is to form a specific 
flavor of soy sauce and produce fresh flavor ingredients 
(Wei et al. 2013). A. oryzae, which has a strong ability to 
digest soybean protein, is an important filamentous fun -
gus in the process of making koji in soy sauce (Liang et al. 
2009), while Lactobacillus plantarum and yeast are used 
as inoculants in the process of moromi fermentation 
(Singracha et  al. 2017). A. oryzae is rich in alkaline and 
neutral proteases, but less active in acid proteases (Gao 
et al. 2010). Given that the brewing process of soy sauce 
is a low pH and high salt system, the alkaline proteases in 
A. oryzae gradually lose their activity under acidic con -
ditions, so neutral proteases dominate in this phase (Hu 
et  al. 2020b). In general, most extracellular proteases of 
A. oryzae are salt-intolerant and are rapidly inactivated 
during the first few days of moromi fermentation, result -
ing in a decrease in raw material utilization and flavor 
content of soy sauce (Gao et al. 2020).
Various strategies have been used to improve the ability 
of Aspergillus  to produce STPs in soy sauce production. 
Through  N+ ion implantation mutagenesis, a mutated 
strain A100-8 of A. oryzae 3.042 with improved protease 
production has been derived, exhibiting an approxi -
mately 44.1% increase in salt-tolerant acid protease 
activity (Zhao et al. 2012). A. oryzae 3.042 has also been 
modified using atmospheric pressure and room tempera -
ture plasma techniques (Gao et  al. 2020). The obtained 
mutant H8 has high STP activity and is able to signifi -
cantly increase the amount of peptides and free amino 
acids in soy sauce. Similarly, the expression of several key 
hydrolase genes from Aspergillus sojae or A. oryzae, such 
as protease, peptidase, and glutaminase, in the salt-tol -
erant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii not only increases 
the yield of STPs, but also serves as a potential means to 
provide additional hydrolase during soy sauce fermenta -
tion (Yuzuki et al. 2015).In addition to genetic modification, exogenous addition 
of STPs has been shown to be effective in improving pro -
tein utilization in soy sauce brewing ingredients and soy 
sauce fermentation quality (Chen et  al. 2023). Previous 
studies have reported the purification of various STPs 
from A. oryzae, including salt-tolerant acid protease (Lee 
et  al. 2010), salt-tolerant neutral protease (Wang et  al. 
2013), salt-tolerant alkaline protease (Gao et  al. 2019), 
and salt-tolerant aspartate aminopeptidase (Gao et  al. 
2018). The STP from A. oryzae LK-101 is relatively sta -
ble at pH 4.5–7.5, below 40 °C, and up to 10% salt con -
centration, which suggests that it may perform various 
functions in soy sauce and even fish sauce fermentation, 
especially to improve flavor by hydrolyzing protein sub -
strates (Lee et al. 2010). The salt-tolerant neutral protease 
derived from A. oryzae CICIM F0899 shows robust salt 
tolerance up to 18% NaCl and significant thermal stabil -
ity under saline conditions (Wang et  al. 2013). Further -
more, results from a small pilot scale of 0.5 to 5.0 L using 
the enzyme in soy sauce production have shown promise 
for the enzyme in soy sauce production. The STP from 
A. oryzae 3.042 exhibits greater stability under high-salt 
conditions compared to non-STPs, and its presence is 
strongly associated with soy sauce quality and raw mate -
rial utilization (Gao et  al. 2019). Salt-tolerant aspartyl 
aminopeptidase is capable of specifically releasing fresh-
flavored glutamate and aspartic acid with low threshold 
values from peptides containing glutamate and aspar -
tic acid residues at the N-terminus of soybean proteins, 
which plays a key role in fermented soybean products 
(Gao et al. 2018; Stressler et al. 2016). Remarkably, salt-
tolerant aspartyl aminopeptidase from A. oryzae 3.042 
demonstrates excellent salt tolerance and holds great 
promise for applications in the production of soy sauce, 
soy paste, sufu, and tempeh (Gao et al. 2018). Glutamyl 
transpeptidase is another pivotal enzyme involved in glu -
tamate production during high salt fermentation of soy 
sauce by A. oryzae. The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 
derived from Aspergillus sydowii exhibits high activity 
even under high-salt conditions (Senba et al. 2023). It has 
also been shown to increase the levels of the fresh flavor 
amino acid L-glutamate in soy sauce. Immobilized B. 
subtilis bacteria with a novel salt-tolerant L-glutaminase 
have been applied to high-salt dilute soy sauce brew -
ing, resulting in a 45.9% increase in L-glutaminase levels 
(Zhang et al. 2022a). Collectively, these salt-tolerant pro -
teases play a key role in soy sauce fermentation by accel -
erating fermentation, increasing raw material utilization, 
enhancing product flavor, shortening the production 
cycle, and reducing production costs.Page 17 of 23

Application in soy paste fermentation
Soy paste generally refers to one of the condiments made 
from soybeans, broad beans, and other bean bases mixed 
with salt water and spices in a certain container after a 
long fermentation. Its name varies across regions: Daji -
ang in Northeast China, Doenjang in South Korea, and 
miso in Japan (Chun et al. 2020; Yue et al. 2021). Like soy 
sauce, soy paste undergoes a long fermentation period of 
2–6  months. During the fermentation phase, enzymes 
produced by microbial growth and reproduction are used 
to break down proteins, starches, and other components 
in the raw material. These transformations produce pep -
tides, free amino acids, and sugars, resulting in the dis -
tinctive flavor and color of soy paste (Zhou et al. 2021).
Aspergillus  species, especially A. oryzae, are the main 
microorganisms used in soy paste fermentation, produc -
ing a variety of STPs (Ao et  al. 2018). Currently, many 
strategies such as the selection of excellent enzyme-
producing microorganisms and the co-fermentation of 
multiple strains have been employed to expedite the fer -
mentation cycle, reduce production costs and enhance 
the flavor profile of soy paste. By subjecting A. sojae to 
successive mutagenesis using several conventional muta -
genic breeding methods, the mutant EUN13 has been 
obtained, exhibiting a 3.8-fold increase in STP yield 
compared to the parent strain (Lim et al. 2019). Co-cul -
tivation of A. oryzae QM-6 with A. niger QH-3 has been 
shown to enhance STP activity in Pixian broad-bean 
paste, resulting in high protease activity in broad-bean 
koji (Tang et  al. 2020). Ninety-seven strains have been 
isolated from broad beans, and 16S rDNA, ITS (internal 
transcribed spacer), and 26S rDNA sequences have been 
analyzed based on morphological classification. Bacterial 
strains have significantly higher protease and peptidase 
activity compared to yeast and molds (Zhou et al. 2021). 
However, simulations of the fermentation of broad bean 
paste by two salt-tolerant fungi and two salt-tolerant 
bacteria have shown that the total protein, peptide, and 
amino acid content is higher in the fungal group than 
in the bacterial group (Lin et  al. 2022). Fungal-derived 
enzyme systems have demonstrated greater albumin 
and glutenin activity under neutral conditions. These 
variations may arise from differences in the physical 
and chemical properties of STPs from different sources, 
resulting in different hydrolysis conditions and different 
properties of the final peptide product (Tang 2017).
The synergistic fermentation of soybean residue and 
soybean meal by adding of exogenous proteases and 
specific strains has shown promising results (Heng 
et  al. 2022). This method stimulates the growth of fer -
menting microorganisms and increases the content of 
organic acids, ultimately improving both fermentation 
efficiency and substrate utilization. These studies show that synergistic fermentation of soy paste using STPs and 
microorganisms promotes the availability of a rich sys -
tem of salt-tolerant enzymes. This beneficial combination 
leads to improved fermentation efficiency and enhances 
the overall flavor quality of the product. Similarly, com -
bining STPs with Lactobacillus brevis GABA 100 and A. 
oryzae KACC 40250 effectively accelerates the produc -
tion of aminobutyric acid and flavonoid glycosides in 
Korean doenjang, significantly reducing the manufac -
turing time of the product (Li et  al. 2017). Salt-tolerant 
aminopeptidase from marine B. licheniformis can effec -
tively improve the hydrolysis and debittering efficiency of 
soybean isolate protein (Lei et al. 2017). A. oryzae capa -
ble of producing L-leucine aminopeptidase and STPs are 
obtained by conventional stochastic mutagenesis, which 
can be used as industrial fermenters for the production of 
meju, doenjang, and ganjang, as well as novel fermented 
soy-based sauce-like products (Lim et al. 2019). Salt-tol -
erant serine proteases isolated from commercial A. ory -
zae KSK-3 have also been used not only in miso brewing, 
but also as natural preparations for oral fibrinolytic ther -
apies and nutraceuticals (Shirasaka et al. 2012).
Application in sufu fermentation
Sufu, a traditional high-salt bean food, is made by mixing 
tofu with brine and fermenting it with microorganisms. 
It is rich in proteins, lipids, peptides, amino acids, fatty 
acids, and flavor compounds such as alcohols, ketones, 
and aldehydes (Han et  al. 2001). The fermentation pro -
cess of sufu is complex, and its unique flavor and nutri -
tional value are influenced by the type and metabolic 
activity of the microorganisms involved in the fermenta -
tion process (Li et al. 2021b). The microflora determines 
its safety, smell, and nutritional quality (Li et al. 2021b). 
Through the analysis of the core functional microbiota 
related to flavor compounds in the eight stages of natu -
rally fermented bean curd, the results have shown that 
nine types of bacteria (Bacillus , Enterobacter, Lactoba -
cillus , Sphingobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Tetrageno -
coccus, Trabulsiella, Unclassified, and Weissella) and 
six species of fungi (Alternaria, Sterigmatomyces, Acti-
nomucor, Fusarium , Debaryomyces, and Candida) are 
identified as the core functional microbiota. These micro -
organisms can significantly affect the production of flavor 
compounds in the process of natural production process 
(He and Chung 2020). During fermentation, the metabo -
lism of these microorganisms converts macromolecular 
proteins and fats into small molecular compounds such 
as peptides, amino acids, and fatty acids (Li et al. 2021b).
In addition to these specifically functional microorgan -
isms, the fermentation of sufu also relies heavily on salt-
tolerant enzymes, primarily proteases, α-amylases, and 
lipases (He et al. 2022). In fact, the fermentation process Page 18 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
of sufu mainly involves biochemical and physical changes 
involving the degradation of proteins, lipids, and sugars 
(Chou and Hwan 1994). It has been shown that these 
chemical changes in the fermentation process of sufu, 
especially in the ripening process, are affected by sodium 
chloride and ethanol (Han et  al. 2003). The addition of 
alcohol to the brine solution not only preserves but also 
slows down the hydrolysis of proteins during aging (Chou 
and Hwan 1994). These factors contribute to the long 
production cycle (usually 3–6 months) of sufu like other 
high-salt soy-fermented foods, which limits its industrial 
production (Feng et al. 2014; Han et al. 2004).
In recent years, there has been a surge in research 
efforts to expedite the production cycle of sufu. Fer -
mentation with multiple strains rather than a single 
strain, such as Mucor and Rhizopus hybrid fermentation. 
Mucor can secrete abundant STPs and other beneficial 
enzymes, while Rhizopus can produce small amounts 
of ethanol and organic acids, and its growth tempera -
ture is lower than that of Mucor. Therefore, Rhizopus is 
used in the fermentation process of sufu, which breaks 
the seasonal limitation of sufu production and reduces 
the amount of ethanol in sufu fermentation (Wang et al. 
2020). The introduction of a mixed starter consisting of 
yeast and lactic acid bacteria has been shown to be ben -
eficial in enhancing sufu fermentation (Xie et  al. 2018). 
This approach not only increases the activity of salt-
tolerant enzymes such as protease, lipase, peptidase, 
and α-amylase but also contributes to the enrichment 
of free amino acids and other functional components, 
resulting in sufu with distinct characteristics in terms 
of color, aroma, taste, and functional substances. Tak -
ing advantage of its ability to thrive and its abundance of 
salt-tolerant enzymes in low-temperature environments, 
Aspergillus flavus has been employed in cryogenic fer -
mentation of sufu, effectively addressing the limitation of 
commercial sufu production at low temperatures (Cheng 
et al. 2009).
Furthermore, the addition of exogenous salt-tolerant 
enzymes is widely utilized as a convenient approach in 
commercial applications. This approach enhances the 
enzymatic system of fermenting microorganisms and 
capitalizes on the synergistic effect between microorgan -
isms and enzymes. As a result, it not only streamlines the 
production process and reduces the production cycle, 
but also enhances product quality and environmental 
hygiene. Studies have reported that the addition of STP 
as an adjuvant to the fermentation process of Kedong 
sufu (a typical sufu fermented using bacteria) (Feng et al. 
2014). The levels of water-soluble proteins, amino acid 
nitrogen, peptides, total free amino acids, and 11 out of 
17 free amino acids are significantly higher compared to 
the control group without enzyme addition, indicating that the ripening of sufu can be accelerated and the rip -
ening time of sufu can be shortened by adding STPs. 
Similarly, accelerated ripening by exogenous proteases 
has also been demonstrated in cheese (Kilcawley et  al. 
2012). In addition, the use of STPs has been shown to be 
effective in enhancing the flavor and product quality of 
Tofu-misozuke (a food inherent to the Fukuoka district 
of Japan is a type of soybean curd fermented in miso) 
(Funaki et  al. 1997). Mold-fermented sufu and enzy -
matically ripened sufu (by soaking salted tofu cubes in 
the prepared koji mash containing various salt-resistant 
hydrolases) are two common processes used in sufu mak -
ing. Studies have reported that the fermentation cycle 
of koji enzyme-ripened sufu typically takes only about 
two to three weeks compared to that of mold-fermented 
sufu, which is much shorter than the four to six months 
required to prepare mold-fermented sufu (Feng et  al. 
2014; Li et al. 2010). This suggests that the rate of hydrol -
ysis by the addition of salt-resistant enzymes, especially 
STPs, is higher than that of mold-fermented sufu during 
the production of sufu.
Conclusion
Due to their specificity, STPs have gradually been recog -
nized as promising candidates for applications in various 
fields. The improvement of salt tolerance of proteases 
based on various modern biotechnologies needs to be 
established on the basis of elucidating the mechanism 
of salt tolerance of proteases. However, salt-tolerant 
mechanisms of STPs from different microbial sources 
are unclear. Whole genome sequencing, transcriptome 
sequencing, and proteome sequencing of salt-tolerant 
microorganisms have been performed using bioinfor -
matics methods to understand their genome structure, 
biosynthesis, and metabolic pathways, and to explore 
the types of genes associated with STPs. The relationship 
among salt-tolerant microorganisms, genes involved in 
STPs, and STPs should be clarified. Exploring the inter -
play between protease sequence structure, spatial con -
formation, functional properties, and salt stress, and 
elucidating the salt tolerance mechanisms of STPs from 
different microbial sources is a research focus. Visual 
analysis and protein engineering techniques can be com -
bined to achieve this.
In addition, low yield, poor stability, and limited cata -
lytic efficiency are also issues that need to be addressed 
in the context of STPs and their application to high-salt 
traditional fermented foods. Given the low yield of salt-
tolerant enzymes, one important research direction is 
to use a combination of traditional microbial screening 
techniques and modern molecular biology techniques 
to rapidly, accurately, and efficiently screen and identify Page 19 of 23
 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 
 
microorganisms from more ecological environments that 
can produce abundant STPs. Another way to address the 
problem of low microbial enzyme production is to use 
multi-omics techniques to mine the salt-tolerant genes of 
salt-tolerant microorganisms in combination with high-
efficiency heterologous expression systems to rapidly 
obtain low-cost STP products. Due to the poor stabil -
ity and limited catalytic efficiency of STPs, appropriate 
immobilization methods or techniques can be chosen 
to construct stable and efficient immobilized STPs to 
improve the rate of reaction between enzyme and sub -
strate matrix, enzyme stability, and multiplexing. In addi -
tion, rational design and modification of STP molecules 
based on modern biotechnology to improve enzyme 
activity and stability is one of the future research direc -
tions for STPs. Of course, various computer-aided tech -
niques (such as protein database and model construction, 
big data analysis and processing, artificial intelligence 
prediction and accurate identification) can help further 
explore the physiological and metabolic properties of 
STPs and salt-tolerant microorganisms to improve pro -
duction efficiency and output quality. In the future, STPs 
will be used more and more widely in various fields. At 
the same time, methods to improve the properties of 
STPs will continue to be innovated, which will lay a 
solid foundation for their greater usefulness in practical 
applications.
