Wastewater treatmentSalt-tolerance aerobic granular sludgeFormationMicrobial communityABSTRACT
The salt-tolerance aerobic granular sludge (SAGS) dominated by moderately halophilic bacteria was successfully
cultured in a 9% (w/v) salty, lab-scale sequence batch reactor (SBR) system. In ﬂuence of high salinity (0 –9% w/
v NaCl) on the formation, performance and microbial succession of the SAGS were explored. Crystal nucleus
hypothesis, selection pressure hypothesis and compressed double electric layers hypothesis were used to discussthe formation mechanism of SAGS. Notably, salinity could be seen as a kind of selection pressure contributed to
the formation of SAGS, while salinity also declined the performance of SAGS system. High throughput 16S rRNA
gene analysis showed that the salinity had great in ﬂuence on the species succession and community structure of
SAGS. Moreover, Salinicola and Halomonas were dominant at 9% salt concentration, therefore moderate halo-
philes were identi ﬁed as functional groups for the tolerance of hypersaline stress.
1. Introduction
Nowadays salinity is considered as a common stress factor in was-
tewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially in industrial sectors, such
as pickling, cheese manufacturing, seafood processing, tanning and
pharmaceuticals ( Moussa et al., 2006 ). Physical-chemical methods were
conventionally used to treat the saline wastewater, while the cost wasparticularly high. Thus, choosing an alternative technology treating
saline wastewater is urgent.
The traditional-activated sludge process has been proved to be a
feasible, cost-e ﬀective treatment for degradation of organic pollutants
in saline wastewater, which represents as much as 5% of worldwide
eﬄuent treatment requirements ( Lefebvre et al., 2007). Besides, aerobic
granular sludge, a promising biological treatment technology, has re-cently received more attention due to its remarkable settling char-
acteristics, which can result in high sludge concentration and low re-
actor space ( Abbas et al., 2015; Adav et al., 2008 ).
In recent years, much e ﬀort has been paid to study the e ﬀect of
salinity on the performance and microbial community of aerobic
granular sludge in SBR system ( Lefebvre et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015;
Zhao et al., 2016). Besides, with the development of sequencing tech-nique, high-throughput sequencing technology has been used to explore
microbial communities under various environmental conditions. For
example, high-throughput sequencing was used to study theperformance and microbial community pro ﬁles in a SBR from 0 wt% to
3.0 wt% salinity, and found that Actinobacteria was dominant at salinity
higher than 2.5 wt% ( Zhao et al., 2016 ).Wang et al. (2016) reported
that salinity had selective e ﬀects on the microbial community structure,
and salt-resistant microbes contributed to the rising of richness and
diversity at 2% and 4% NaCl stress. Salinity is known to in ﬂuence the
degradation rate through the inhibition of microbial activity or enzymeactivity. Besides, with the increase of salinity, the water density cor-
respondingly increased, causing the adverse e ﬀect on the settling
characteristics. However, Moussa et al. (2006) reported that gradually
increase salinity will stimulate the selection of dense ﬂocs with
minimum washout, and higher salt contents evolved a better settling
sludge. Therefore, the hypersaline stress may not only shift the domi-
nated microbial species, especially for some halotolerant bacteria, but
also in ﬂuence the formation process of granular sludge. In addition, the
forming characteristics of salt-tolerant granular sludge and microbialcommunity succession with elevated salinity were still unclear.
In this study, a lab-scale SBR was introduced to explore the per-
formance, formation and microbial succession of salt-tolerance granular
sludge respond to hypersaline stress (0 –9% w/v NaCl). The 16S rRNA
gene high-throughput sequencing was applied to decipher the speciessuccession and community structure of salt-tolerance granular sludge
and to identify the role of some functional salt-tolerant bacteria in salt-
tolerance aerobic granular sludge system. The study provided detailed

Tinformation of species succession for salt-tolerant granular system from
0% to 9% (w/v) salinity and a better understanding for the application
of granular sludge in treating saline wastewater.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reactor set-up and operation optimization
A lab-scale SBR was operated for about 160 days, for culturing salt-
tolerate granular sludge. The system was controlled by a programmable
logic controller (PLC) and was maintained at room temperature
(22 ± 2 °C). The reactor was 100 cm height with 8 cm internal dia-
meter, its working height was 80 cm, so that the height/diameter ratio
(H/D) was 10. The aeration was introduced by an air pump, and two
peristaltic pumps were used to drive the in ﬂuent and e ﬄuent water, the
volumetric exchange ratio (VER) was 50% for each cycle. Every oper-ated cycle of the reactor took 6 h. Generally each cycle included 5 min
of feeding, 0– 30 min of anaerobic phase, 150– 180 min of aerobic phase,
3–30 min of settling time and 5 min of e ﬄuent discharge phase. To
optimize the system performance, the reactor operation parameters
were adjusted throughout the whole operation process, such as settling
time, in ﬂuent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and aerobic/anaerobic
time ( Long et al., 2014 ), and all operation parameters were summarized
inTable 1.
2.2. Seed sludge and wastewater composition
The activated sludge was collected from the recycled sludge of the
secondary clariﬁ er in the Changqiao municipal wastewater treatment
plant in Shanghai, China. Then, the inoculated sludge was consisted the
100 mL anaerobic granular sludge with the aerobic activated sludge.
The initial mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) level was 3.36 g L
−1
and the sludge volume index (SVI) was 148.8 mL g−1in the SBR
system. The glucose was added as carbon source, and the in ﬂuent or-
ganic concentration was between 1000 and 2500 mg COD L−1. The
synthetic wastewater was composed of (mg L−1): NH 4Cl (500); KH 2PO4
(140); CaCl 2(150); MgCl 2(31); and FeSO 4·7H 2O (10). The in ﬂuent pH
was maintained at 7.0 ± 0.1 by adding 2 M NaHCO 3or HCl solution.
In addition, 2.5 mL of trace element solution was added into 50 L ofinﬂuent, which contained (in mg L
−1): H 3BO3(50); ZnCl 2(50); CuCl 2
(30); MnSO 4·H2O (50); (NH 4)6Mo7O24·4H 2O (50); AlCl 3(50);
CoCl 2·6H 2O (50); and NiCl 2(50) ( Ren et al., 2008).
2.3. DNA extraction, high-throughput sequencing and analysis
Granular sludge was collected at di ﬀerent salt concentrations: 0%,
3%, 6%, 8% and 9% for DNA extraction. Then, the sludge samples werestored at −80 °C. The 3S DNA Isolation Kit for Environmental Samples
(Shenergy Biocolor, China) was used to extract DNA according to theprotocol, after extraction, 1% agarose gels electrophoresis was used to
examine the quality of DNA. The V3-V4 region of the 16s rRNA genewas ampli ﬁed by the bacterial primers 338F (5 ′-ACT CCT ACG GGA
GGC AGC AG-3 ′) and 806R (5 ′-GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-3 ′),
and marked by the reverse primer including a 6bp barcode ( Zhao et al.,
2016 ). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in 50 µL
mixtures containing 25 µL of 2 × taq PCR Mix, 22 µL of ddH
2O, 1 µL of
each primer, and 1 µL of template DNA, and the PCR products wereconﬁrmed using electrophoresis through 1% w/w agarose gel. Ampli-
cons were extracted from 2% agarose gels, puri ﬁed by the AxyPrep
DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer ’s instructions, then quanti ﬁed with
QuantiFluor ™-ST (Promega, USA). Puri ﬁed amplicons were pooled in
the equimolar mixture and paired-end sequenced (2 × 250) on an Il-
lumina MiSeq platform at Major Bio-Pharm Technology CO., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China) ( Yan et al., 2016). After that, the processing of raw
data was conducted as previous studies ( Guo et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2016 ). Lastly, the raw reads were deposited into the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) database (Access Number: SRX2175355).
2.4. Analytical methods
The conventional indexes of COD, MLSS, mixed liquor volatile
suspended solids (MLVSS), and SVI were analyzed according to the
Standard Methods.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Performance and formation of SAGS
The SBR system was operated in three di ﬀerent phases ( Fig. 1 ), and
the operational conditions of SBR system were listed in Table 1. The
performance in each phase including MLSS, MLVSS, SVI and removal
rate was described as follows:
Phase I (start-up): During the phase I, the in ﬂuent COD concentra-
tion varied from 1000 to 1800 mg L
−1as the salinity increased from 0%
to 3%, the system always showed a high COD removal rate of greaterthan 85%. In case of excessive loss of sludge, the system initially
maintained the 30 min settling time, so that the MLSS and MLVSS in-
creased signi ﬁcantly, and the sludge maintained the ﬂocculent mor-
phology. When salt concentration gradually increased from 2% to 3%,the settling time decreased from 30 min to 15 min to promote the for-
mation of granular sludge. Moreover, anaerobic time (20 min) was in-
troduced to inhibit the overgrowth of ﬁlamentous bacteria at 2% salt
concentration, and with the increase of salinity the anaerobic timeextended to 30 min, which was an e ﬀective way to decrease the dis-
integration of aerobic granular sludge ( Long et al., 2014 ). The granular
sludge emerged on day 32, soon after that MLSS and SVI were found to
reduce considerably due to the wash out of ﬂoc sludge, which was as-
sociated to the reduce of settling time and the increase of wastewaterdensity caused by salinity.
Phase II (acclimation under saline stress): The system was continued
to operate at 4– 6% saline stress, and the settling time further decreased

133to 3– 5 min. With the maturation of granular sludge, the MLSS and
MLVSS showed little changed in this phase. While the salinity increased
from 5% to 6%, SVI decreased and MLSS increased sharply. With
continuous double pressure of salinity and settling time, the granular
sludge dominated gradually, which accounted for more than 90% in the
SBR system. Besides, the COD removal rate decreased from 88% to
54%. As previous reports ( Yogalakshmi and Joseph, 2010; Zhao et al.,
2016 ), the increase of salinity inhibited the microbial metabolism,
thereby reduced the degradation ability of SAGS.
Phase III (elevated salt concentration): However, the salt stress in-
creasing from 7% to 9% salinity had little in ﬂuence on the removal of
COD, the system could maintain about 50% removal rate. In this period,the MLSS and MLVSS continuously increased to 6.36 and 5.82 g L
−1
respectively, the SVI had no obvious ﬂuctuation and maintained at
about 54 mL g−1. The SAGS was observed to dominate in SBR system at
7–9% salinity.
3.2. Bacterial community analysis
The high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore
the microbial community structure and characteristics of SAGS re-
sponding to hypersaline stress. The activated sludge were collected at
0%, 3%, 6%, 8% and 9% salt concentrations to characterize the mi-
crobial community, which were labeled as 0, 3, 6, 8 and 9, respectively.
All samples were collected at the same operation conditions to reduce
operating errors.
A total of 175,162 e ﬀective reads (36,697, 31,450, 31,843, 40,789
and 34,383 for 0%, 3%, 6%, 8% and 9%, respectively) were obtained by
the MiSeq pyrosequencing from sludge samples at di ﬀerent salt con-
centration. Each sample was then normalized to 31,450 sequences, thenconducted the downstream analyses to obtain 115(0%), 96(3%),
82(6%), 66(8%) and 54(9%) operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at
97% similarity threshold. Rarefaction curve ( Fig. 2) was employed to
standardize and compare the observed taxon richness among 6 samplesand to verify the representativeness of collected samples ( He et al.,
2016 ). As shown in Fig. 2, all curves tended to be ﬂat as sequence
numbers increased, indicating that the sequence volume was reasonableto represent almost microbial community of six sludge samples. This
could be also con ﬁrmed by the high coverage ( Table 2).
In addition, the community richness was characterized by Chao
values and abundance-based coverage estimation (ACE). The results
showed that 0% sample had the highest species richness. With theincrease of salt concentration, the species richness decreased obviously.
It may be related to the selection pressure of high salinity, some bac-
teria were not suitable for high salt conditions, causing the reduction of
community richness. Moreover, the Shannon and Simpson values were
used to evaluate the community diversity ( Li et al., 2016 ). Results
showed that the 6% sample had the highest diversity, afterward, thediversity decreased sharply. The 6% salt concentration seemed to be a
threshold for microbial diversity, which increased at 0 –6% salinities,
while decreased due to the higher salt concentration at 7 –9% salinities.
Venn diagram depicted ( Fig. 3) that only 6.05% of total OTUs were
the shared OUTs among the six sludge samples, so that the variation ofmicrobial structure happened along with elevated salinities. Some
bacteria adapting to high salinity grew well and gradually pre-
dominated in the SBR system, while others without salt-tolerance ca-
pacity were gradually washed out or weakened with increasing salinity.
Besides, the prosperity of some halophilic bacteria changed the di-
versity and richness of microbial community. In addition, the shared
OTUs between adjacent samples 0% and 3%, 3% and 6%, 6% and 8%,
8% and 9% were 23.92%, 31.46%, 31.76% and 38.33%, respectively,
indicating samples from closer salt concentration had more similarities
in the microbial community composition, and the succession of the
microbial community was a gradual process.

1343.3. Dynamics and functional groups of the microbial community
The gene taxonomic analysis for six di ﬀerent salinity samples as-
signed to phylum, class and genus taxa levels were summarized at
Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4a, the phylum Proteobacteria predominated in
the whole operating process, which was similar to other microbialcommunity from di ﬀerent environment areas, such as soil ( Roesch
et al., 2007) and sewage ( Zhang et al., 2012). The second most domi-
nant phylum was Firmicutes in six sludge samples. Moreover, the re-
lative abundance of these two phyla was over 98%, and the Proteo-
bacteria maintained over 80% abundance in all sludge samples. In
addition, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased at 0– 6% sali-
nity and decreased at 6– 9% salinity, but the relative abundance of
Proteobacteria appeared the opposite trend compared with the abun-
dance of Firmicutes . The results showed that Proteobacteria had a wider
range of salinity (0 –9%) compared with the Firmicutes (0–6%) ac-
cording to its high relative abundance of phylum taxa level in di ﬀerent
salinity. It was noteworthy that the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes
were always detected in some adverse environmental conditions ( Li
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016 ). For example, the phyla Proteobacteria
and Firmicutes were detected and dominant in all antibiotic containingwater samples ( Li et al., 2011 ).Proteobacteria was also found to dom-
inate in saline wastewater, and presented the increasing trend frominitial 33.4% to 79.6% and 85.1% when salt concentrations increased
from 0 to 50 g L
−1(Zhang et al., 2016 ).
The taxonomic analysis at the class level was summarized at Fig. 4b.
The six main classes were detected in all samples, including Gamma-
proteobacteria ,Bacilli ,Alphaproteobacteria ,Clostridia, Epsilonproteo-
bacteria and Actinobacteria respectively. Notably, the Gammaproteo-
bacteria had the highest abundance in class level and was always
dominant at di ﬀerent salt stages. In addition, the Bacilli accumulated at
0–6% salinity and its highest abundance was 12.3% at 6% salinity, after
that, the abundance of Bacilli decreased from 9.1% to 6.2% with the
salinity increased from 8% to 9%. It was worth noting that Epsilonpro-
teobacteria was 2.27% abundance at 0% salinity, while it was un-
detected at 3% salinity. The abundance of Alphaproteobacteria increased
to 5.4% at 6% salinity and decreased sharply at 8 –9% salinity. It may
indicate that Bacilli and Alphaproteobacteria could tolerate salinity in
some extent, when salinity increased more than the tolerance limit of
these classes, the microbe may be weakened or be washed out from the
SBR system, which was corresponding with the variation of community
diversity ( Table 2). And the Gammaproteobacteria seemed to have betterTable 2

135ability to tolerate higher salt stress compared with other main classes.
Fig. 4c clariﬁ ed the taxonomic analysis of six samples at genus level,
which could have more detailed information and more profound com-
prehension on microbial community succession with the elevated salt
concentration in the SBR system. The dynamic variation of microbial
distribution during the whole operating process could be clearly seem
inFig. 4c. The microbial community structures at elevated salinity were
quite di ﬀerent at genus level, moreover, some genera showed an in-
creasing or decreasing tendency with elevated salinity. For example,
thePseudoalteromonas has the highest abundance, 75.8%, at 0% salinity
and was predominant in the SBR system. While the Pseudoalteromonas
dropped sharply with the addition of salinity, even the abundance of
Pseudoalteromonas decreased to 0.003% at 9% salt concentration, which
could conclude that the Pseudoalteromonas was dramatically a ﬀected by
higher salinity (8% and 9% salinity). On the contrary, the Salinicola was
not detected at 0% salinity, while with the increasing salinity, theabundance of Salinicola gradually increased to 2.4%, 33.3%, 59.4% and
92% at 3%, 6%, 8% and 9% salinity respectively. And the Salinicola
became the most dominant genus of SAGS at 9% salinity in the SBR
system. This increasing dynamic change indicated that the Salinicola
was capable to adapt the hypersaline stress and contributed a lot togranular sludge for the tolerance of salinity. In addition, the Halomonas
appeared the similar increasing trend with the increase of salinity, and
dominated in aerobic granular sludge, which was 24% relative abun-
dance at 6% salt concentration. But with the enhanced salinity, the
abundance of the Halomonas dropped from 6.83% to 0.1% at 8– 9%
salinity. The Bacillus was always existed in all sludge samples during the
whole process with the increase of salinity, and the abundance of this
genus was 3.88%, 8.38%, 7.34%, 5.2% and 4.7% respectively along
with the increasing salinity, indicating that the Bacillus could adapt the
wide range of salt concentration (0 –9%). Bacillus, Pseudoalteromonas,
Halomonas and other halophilic microorganisms were often isolated
from di ﬀerent saline environments and some di ﬀerent strains even
belonged to the same genus ( Zhuang et al., 2010 ).
From the microbial functional groups perspective, the existence of
some halophilic or halotolerant bacteria made aerobic granular sludge
adapt to live and thrive in hypersaline stress. Moreover, saline condi-
tions could stimulate bacteria produce more extracellular polymeric
substances (EPS) to protect themselves from adverse environment. With
the increase of salinity step by step, an aerobic granular sludge system
dominated by moderately halophilic genera was gradually formed withincreasing relative abundance of Salinicola andHalomonas. Besides, the
Salinicola and Halomonas was the member of the family
Halomonadaceae, which showed a remarkable versatility with respectto their salt tolerance ( Vargas and Nieto, 2004 ).de la Haba et al. (2010)
found that the Salinicola socius DSM 19940
Tgrew optimally in media
containing 3– 10% NaCl and Halomonas salaria DSM 18044Tgrew op-
timally in media containing 10– 20% NaCl. The phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 5) showed that Salinicola and Halomonas constituted a coherent
cluster, which indicated that these two genera were phylogeneticallyclosely related and had same salt-tolerant function.
Moreover, some researchers studied the e ﬀect of salinity on mi-
crobial community at the range of 0– 5% salt concentration, or detected
the microbial community using two or three di ﬀerent salinity level of
sludge samples ( Ramos et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhao et al.,
2016 ). In this study, the wider range of salinity level (0 –9%) and the
strategy of stepped increased of salinity provided more detailed mi-
crobial succession information of SAGS, and demonstrated the stepped
increase of the relative abundance of Salinicola with the increase of
salinity.
3.4. Formation mechanism of SAGS
The formation of salt-tolerant granular could be explained as fol-
lowing 3 mechanisms:(1) Crystal nucleus hypothesis considered the
formation of granular sludge started with some nucleuses, which in-
oculated aerobic (anaerobic) granules, inorganic material or some in-
organic salt into SBR system as a crystal nucleus, aerobic granular
sludge will gradually form through microbial growth with the help of a
nucleus ( Long et al., 2014 ). The nuclei of granular activated carbon
provided the supporting media for sludge to attach and enhance themorphological regularization of sludge ( Tao et al., 2017 ).Verawaty
et al. (2012) also found that ﬂocs were observed to attach to the surface
of the seeding granules, resulting in reduced biomass washout during
granulation. In such experiment, the addition of anaerobic granules
provided the sludge for strong support medium in the initial start-upphase. On the basis of the anaerobic nucleus, young granules gradually
formed with the growth of microbes. (2) Selection pressure hypothesis
could be separated as hydraulic selection pressure and biological se-
lection pressure, which was widely used to optimize the operation
parameters of reactor and to explain the formation of aerobic granular
sludge. In such experiment, one selection pressure was the settling time,
Fig. 4. Analysis of microbial diversity at di ﬀerent taxo-
nomic level for di ﬀerent salinity samples: phylum (a); class
(b); genus (c).D. Ou et al. Bioresource Technology 249 (2018) 132–138
136which was considered as a successful strategy for the rapid start-up of
aerobic granular reactors ( Szabó et al., 2016). Su et al. (2013) also
suggested that automatically adjusted of settling time was an optimumcontrolling strategy for granulation process. When settling time con-
tinuously decreased from 30 min to 3 min, young granules were pushed
to adhere more focs and ﬂocs were pushed to get together to obtain
enough weight, so that the lighter ﬂocs were washed out and the en-
ough heavy young granules accumulated in the system. It was worth
noting that the other selection pressure was salt concentration, which
can be seen not only as hydraulic selection pressure but also as biolo-
gical selection pressure. As a hydraulic selection pressure, with stepped
increase of salt concentration from 0% to 9%, synthetic wastewater
density correspondingly increased, resulting only bigger ﬂocs or young
granules could stay in the SBR system, which could be seen as the en-hancement of the function of decreased settling time. Moussa et al.
(2006) also found that the settling time were chosen to allow only
granules to retain, and density played a similar role in systems under
salt stress. As a biological selection pressure, elevated salinity pushed
the SBR system to alter the microbial community to adapt hypersaline
stress. Under high salt concentration (> 1 wt% salinity), the increase of
salinity resulted in an increase of the halotolerant bacteria, and the
microbial community could express di ﬀerent tolerance levels to such a
biological selection pressure of salinity ( Lim et al., 2007). The result of
salinity selection pressure was that some adapted bacteria was capableof salt tolerance, while other unadaptable bacteria was granularly wa-
shed out or weakened with increasing salinity. (3) As described by the
DLVO theory, the double layer becomes compressed at high ionic
strength, reducing the surface potential, but keeping the surface charge
density constant ( Esparza-Soto and Westerho ﬀ, 2003 ). The increase of
salt concentration from 0% to 9% resulted in compressing the doublelayers, reducing the total repulsive forces between di ﬀerent zoogleas,
and improved the mature of young granules. In addition, the combi-nation of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the ﬂocs in-
creased the ﬂock size ( Moussa et al., 2006 ).Li et al. (2017) found thatthe addition of seawater signi ﬁcantly accelerated the granulation pro-
cess compared with freshwater and a salinity-induced decrease in
electrostatic charge on the surface of cells allowed sludge ﬂocculation.
Thereby, it was bene ﬁcial for the aggregation of ﬂocs and the ma-
turation of salt-tolerant granular sludge.
In summary, the strong support material of anaerobic granules
stated the formation process of young granules. With the double se-
lection pressure of settling time and salinity, young granules gradually
accumulated in SBR system, and the halophilic microorganisms en-
riched as the corresponding to the high saline stress. Meanwhile, the
aerobic granular sludge gradually transited from the young stage to
mature stage with the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions. Finally, the salt-tolerant granular sludge was successfully
cultivated in response to the hypersaline stress.
4. Conclusion
The salt-tolerance aerobic granular sludge dominated by moderately
halophilic genera was successfully cultivated in SBR system, and it
could tolerate 9% saline concentration. Crystal nucleus hypothesis,
selection pressure hypothesis and compressed double electric layers
hypothesis were used to explain the formation of salt-tolerant granular
sludge. Notably, salinity contributed a lot to the formation and the
microbial community structure of SAGS, while it declined the perfor-
mance of SAGS system. Sequence analysis showed halophilic bacteriaobviously increased corresponding to the increased salinity. In detail,
Salinicola and Halomonas were gradually dominant and considered as
the functional groups for the tolerance of hypersaline stress.
