Abstract
Background: High salinity (1–10% w/v) of tannery wastew ater makes it difficult to be treated by
conventional biological treatment.  Salt tolerant microbes can adap t to these saline conditions and
degrade the organics in saline wastewater.
Results: Four salt tolerant bacterial strains isolated  from marine and tannery saline wastewater
samples were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus flexus, Exiguobacterium homiense and
Staphylococcus aureus . Growth factors of the identified st rains were optimized. Tannery saline
wastewater obtained from a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) near Chennai (southern
India) was treated with pure and mixed consortia of fo ur salt tolerant bacterial strains. Experiments
with optimized conditions and varying salt conten t (between 2 and 10% (w/v) were conducted. Salt
inhibition effects on COD remova l rate were noted. Comparative analysis was made by treating
the tannery saline wastewater with  activated sludge obtained from  CETP and with natural habitat
microbes present in raw tannery saline wastewater.
Conclusion: Salt tolerant bacterial mixe d consortia showed appreciable biodegradation at all
saline concentrations (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% w/v) with 80% COD reduction in particular at 8%
salinity level the consortia could be used as suitable working cu ltures for tannery saline wastewater
treatment.
Background
Tannery saline wastewater, a primary effluent stream in
leather processing industry is generated by soaking the
salt-laden hides and skins in fresh water to remove excess
salt. The presence of high salinity (1–10% NaCl by wt) in
this waste stream hinders treatment by biological means
[1]. A biomass sludge adapting to varying saline concen-
trations (salt tolerant strains) is required to degrade thedissolved organics present in tannery saline wastewater.
Several groups have made significant contribution to bio-
logical treatment of saline wastewater [2-6]. Kargi and
Dincer treated waste waters rich in halogenated organics
at different salt concentrations and showed COD removal
decreased with increasing salt concentration [7]. Woolard
and Irvine studied the treatment of hypersaline wastewa-
ter by a moderate halophile in a sequencing batch reactorPublished: 29 April 2008

(page number not for citation purposes)and in a biofilm reactor [8,9]. Up to 99% phenol removal
was obtained from a 15% saline wastewater. Again Kargi
and Dincer [10] employed Zooglea ramigera to study salt
inhibition on COD removal in synthetic wastewater in anaerobic fed-batch reactor and further used a halophilicculture, Halobacter halobium to overcome the problem of
plasmolysis and study the performance of biological treat-
ment under high salt concentration [11].
Major problems encountered in biological treatment of
saline wastewaters were (i) a limited extent of adaptation,as conventional cultures could not be effectively used totreat saline wastewaters of values higher than 3–5% (w/v)
salt. (ii) salt adaptations of cultures were easily lost when
subjected to salt-free medium. (iii) changes in ionicstrength cell disruptions due to shifts in salt concentra-tion, from 0.5 to 2% (w/v), caused significant reductionsin system performance [12]. (Even with acclimatized cul-tures, satisfactory performance required a constant ioniccomposition). (iv) rapid changes in salt concentrations
created adverse effects more than gradual changes. Nor-
malization to constant salt concentration is essentialbefore saline wastewaters were treated. Reduced degrada-tion kinetics too occurred. Thus available informationindicated that the removal of BOD by biological treat-ment processes is reduced at salt concentrations above
8,000 mg l
-1. So saline wastewater should be treated at
lower food to micro-organism (F/M) ratios, or higher thanusual bacteria Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids(MLVSS) concentrations. Rapid changes in salt concentra-tion cause adverse effects more than gradual changes. Thetreatment process should provide sufficient hydraulic
retention time (HRT) to even out changes in salt concen-
tration. In recent years there have been a few studies onbiological treatment of tannery soak liquor. Lefebvre et al[13] made an attempt to treat tannery saline wastewaterbiologically. They studied the microbial diversity ofhypersaline tannery wastewater [14] and anaerobic diges-
tion of tannery soak liquor in an Upflow Anaerobic
Sludge Blanket (UASB) reaching 78% COD removal [15].Unidentified microbial consortia and halophillic/moder-ate halophillic cultures were used.
In our study, the focus was on salt concentration on bio-
logical treatment of commercial tannery saline wastewater
inoculated with salt-tolerant bacterial strains and their
mixed consortia isolated and identified from saline envi-ronments. Since the salinity levels of tannery saline waste-water varied everyday, a detailed study was undertakenover a broad range of changes in saline concentration.Corresponding COD removal by the identified salt toler-
ant strains was also followed. The results were compared
with those obtained when commercial tannery activatedsludge was treated. Variation in COD removal rate and itsefficiency with salt concentration were determined. Thiswas perhaps the first attempt on the biological treatment
of tannery saline wastewater employing isolated and iden-
tified salt tolerant bacterial strains individually and inmixed consortia.
Experimental
Materials
Salt tolerant ba cterial strains
Samples taken for salt tolerant bacterial isolation con-
tained seawater, marine soil, salt lake water (15% and20% NaCl w/v) and salt lake sediment clay; Samples werecollected from salt lake around coastal areas in Mahabali-puram (60 km from Chennai) and from Adyar beach in
Chennai. Tannery saline wastewater samples were col-
lected from a commercial tannery at Chromepet, Chen-nai, India. Serial dilution technique was adopted and theseparated colonies (> 10
-6 dilution) were spread plated in
saline nutrient agar plates (varying salt concentrationsfrom 0–25% NaCl (w/v), covering all salt tolerant, mod-erate and extreme halophilic ranges) and incubated at
37°C for 24 h. Screening of potent salt tolerant bacterial
strains was done based on salt tolerance limit and time ofadaptation. The isolated salt tolerant bacterial strains wereidentified by 16S rRNA analysis (MWG AGBiotech, Ban-galore, India) (See additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Culture medium
Isolation of salt tolerant bacterial colonies from salinesamples was made with nutrient agar (Himedia, MO12)media with the following composition (in g l
-1): Peptone;
10, NaCl; 5, Beef extract; 5 and Agar; 15. Solid NaCl wasadded to the agar to obtain the desired salt concentration
and pH was adjusted to 7.0. Cultivation and optimization
experiments were performed with nutrient broth (NB)media with the following composition: Peptic digest ofanimal 5 g l
-1, Yeast extract 1.5 g l-1, Beef extract 1.5 g l-1,
NaCl 5 g l-1. Dunda's media (for salt tolerant bacterial cul-
tivation) composed of MgSO4. 7H2O (20 g l-1), NaCl (150
g l-1), Trisodium citrate dihydrate (3 g l-1) CaCl2. 2H2O (1
g l-1), Peptone (10 g l-1) and Yeast extract (1 g l-1) was also
used in media optimization experiments.
Inoculum preparation
Frozen cultures of pure salt tolerant bacterial coloniesstored in agar slants were inoculated on 5 ml nutrient
broth media at aseptic conditions. The inoculated broth
was incubated in an orbitary shaker (Scigenics, India),150 rpm and 37°C, for 24 h. Well-grown culture suspen-sions with uniform concentration (absorbance at 600 nm≈ 1) were used as sources of inoculum for all growth opti-
mization and wastewater experiments.
Analytical methods
Salinity was measured by the argentometric method [16].Total dissolved and suspended solids were determinedMicrobial Cell Factories  2008, 7:15 http://www.microbialcellfa ctories.com/content/7/1/15
Page 3 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)according to the Standard Methods for Analysis of Water
and Wastewater [17]. Protein content was determined by
the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method. ChemicalOxygen Demand (COD) and Biochemical OxygenDemand (BOD) analyses on the clear supernatant (centri-fuged at 6000 × g for 30 min) of samples were performedaccording to standard methods. Sufficient amount of
HgSO
4 (HgSO4/Cl = 10) was added to the samples to
overcome the chloride ion interference in COD measure-ments. Biomass concentrations (for growth optimizationstudies) were determined by reading the absorbance ofsamples in a UV-spectrophotometer (Shimazdu, UV-2101PC) at 600 nm.
Optimization experiments
Experiments were carried out in shaking flasks for optimi-zation of several growth parameters (Temperature, pH,inoculum conc., salinity, and agitation rate) in syntheticnutrient media. Growth studies on nutrient media favor-ing optimal biomass growth were also performed. In all
optimization studies, the samples (collected at regular
time intervals) were analyzed for biomass growth bymonitoring the absorbance in UV-spectrophotometer(Shimadzu, UV-2101PC) at 600 nm. Growth curves weredrawn (plotting absorbance against time) for each growthcondition and the optimum value of each parameter was
fixed by comparing the growth curves for higher biomass
yield. The results of growth optimization studies for theidentified strains are given in Table 1.
Wastewater
Tannery saline wastewater samples were obtained from
the collection tank of a Common Effluent Treatment
Plant (CETP, Pallavaram, Chennai) designed to treatwastewater generated from nearby tanneries. The waste-water was characterized in terms of: total soluble and sus-pended solids (TDS & TSS), COD, BOD, salinity, TKN andpH respectively (see "Analytical methods"). (See Table 2
for composition).
Biological tannery saline  wastewater treatment
The treatment of tannery saline wastewater was performed
in shaking flasks (100 ml batch size) at varying NaCl con-centrations viz., 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% (w/v). Thenon-sterilized tannery saline wastewater samples were
taken separately and the efficiency of COD removal byisolated salt tolerant bacterial strains was studied by inoc-
ulating them as pure monocultures. Samples were also
run with mixed isolated salt tolerant bacterial consortiaand tannery activated sludge. Blank runs were made withnatural organisms present in raw tannery saline wastewa-ter in similar growth conditions. For each run, 2% (v/v) ofcell suspension was used to inoculate 100 ml tannerysaline wastewater to which were added varying NaCl con-
centrations in 200 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. This was then
incubated at 37°C and 150 rpm in an orbitary shaker.Orbitary motion of the samples sustained sufficientamount of oxygen supply (Dissolved Oxygen > 2 mg/l) toensure aerobic conditions throughout the experiment.Samples were taken out daily and centrifuged at 10000 ×
g for 10 min in a Sigma 3 MK refrigerated centrifuge and
the supernatant was taken up for COD measurements.
Results and discussion
Biochemical analysis and 16s rRNA analysis of the iso-lated salt tolerant bacterial colonies helped to identify
them as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (isolate from tannery
saline wastewater), Bacillus flexus (isolate from marine
soil), Exiguobacterium homiense (isolate from salt-lake
saline liquor) and Staphylococcus aureus (isolate from sea-
water). Occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in marine
sources and its salt tolerance property had already been
reported [18].
Growth optimization
Optimization experiments were performed for the growth
of halotolerant bacterial isolates at shaker level to deter-mine the growth factors simulating higher biomass yield.Composition of media, salinity, inoculum concentration,
pH, temperature, and agitation rate were the parameters

(page number not for citation purposes)optimized. Samples were collected at regular time inter-
vals; the biomass growth was monitored by recording the
absorbance at 600 nm in spectrophotometer. The absorb-ance values were plotted against time to obtain growthcurves.
Values showing an exponential phase and high biomass
yield were found to be optimum. The isolated strains
(P.aeruginosa, B.flexus, E.homiense and S.aureus ) were
grown in two different media (NB & Dundas) under sim-ilar physical environment and growth was ascertained bymeasuring optical density (at 600 nm) of culture for 24 h(results not shown). It was observed that bacterial growth
was maximum in nutrient broth- it being an indication
that the halotolerant bacterial strains were proteolytic innature, readily degrading the large amount of peptone,present in both media. Also, the halotolerant bacterialstrains exhibited a strong stationary phase up to 8 h in NBmedia as compared to the observed phase in Dunda'smedium. This pointed to the long survival ability of the
cultures; NB was also found to be the ideal medium.
Salinity optimization was a parameter of greater impor-tance as the halotolerant bacterial strains were to beemployed for biodegradation of tannery saline wastewa-ter.
Salinity studies showed that P.aeruginosa as well as
S.aureus adapted up to 5% (w/v) and B.flexus, E.homiense
over a wide range (5%, 10% & 15%) of salinity (resultsnot shown). This meant that all the identified strains(P.aeruginosa , B.flexus, E.homiense and S.aureus ) were salt
tolerant. Inoculum concentrations were changed from 2 –
10% (v/v) for each strain, keeping other growth parame-
ters constant. Samples were withdrawn at regular timeintervals and analyzed for growth by recording absorb-ance value at 600 nm (results not shown). Maximum bio-mass yield was taken as criterion to find the optimumvalue. A 4% (v/v) inoculum conc. was found to be opti-
mum for P.aeruginosa and B.flexus and 2% for E.homiense
and S.aureus . Biological saline wastewater treatment
showed improved results when operated at low F/M forhigh salt concentrations [19]. Temperature optimizationstudies proved that all the 4 halotolerant bacterial isolateswere found to be mesophillic (results not shown) asenhanced biomass production was observed in this tem-
perature range (32–37°C). As most of effluent treatment
plants were operated in ambient conditions (especially intropical countries like India were normal day temperaturewas ≥ 30°C), the isolates could actively degrade the tan-
nery saline wastewater. pH optimization results provedthat all the halotolerant bacterial isolates were found to be
nuetrophile (pH 7.0 – 8.0). In soaking operation, com-
mon salt was the main ingredient and it imparted a neu-tral pH to tannery wastewater. Hence no pH correctionwas needed when these strains were employed for biodeg-radation of tannery saline wastewater (they easily
adapted). Optimization of agitation rate for the growth of
identified strains was taken up at different values viz., 100,120, 140, 160 and 180 rpm. This small increment in agi-tation rate showed significant variation in growth rate ofrespective strains. All the four salt tolerant strains showedoptimal growth at 160 rpm and a further increase in agi-
tation rate caused observable fall in growth profile (results
not shown). This could be attributed to the effect of shearrate on cell wall, resulting in cell damage. Optimizationresults indicated that the identified halotolerant bacterialstrains could readily degrade tannery saline wastewater.The summaries of experiments for the 4 halotolerant bac-
terial strains are in Table 1.
Tannery saline wastewater treatment
Tannery saline wastewater degradation studies were done
as batch experiments (incubated shaking flask) with puremonocultures of P.aeruginosa, B.flexus, E.homiense and
S.aureus and their mixed consortia. In CETPs, tannery
saline wastewater was segregated generally separately and
treated in solar ponds to prevent degeneration of tannerysludge in the bioreactor. In order to analyze the efficiencyof the identified strains reported on treatment of tannerysaline wastewater, comparative studies were performedemploying activated tannery sludge and natural habitat
microbes (those present in the raw effluent) separately.
Batch experiments on tannery saline wastewater degrada-tion were performed at optimized growth conditions ofrespective strains as given in Table 1 (inoculum dosage(2% v/v), pH of 7.0, 37°C and at 200 rpm). The presenceof 1.7% of NaCl (by wt) showed that (table 2) tannery
saline wastewater was slightly saline. High TKN and BOD
values further indicated the suitability of the collectedsample for biodegradability studies. In batch experiments,salt concentration was changed from 2–10% (w/v) tominimize commercial tannery saline wastewater salt com-position. Experimental runs were continued till apprecia-
ble COD removal (> 80%) was obtained. Samples were
taken at regular time intervals, analyzed for COD valueand chloride effects were masked by addition of HgSO
4 in
proportion to chloride concentration. Each set of experi-ments was repeated for three times and only mean valuesof the results were discussed. Statistical analysis (ORIGINsoftware) of results for replicas showed a minimum stand-
ard deviation range of ± 3% for most of the experiments.
(Fig. 1 depicts the variation in COD reduction of tannerysaline wastewater salinity, 2% w/v) by salt tolerant bacte-rial isolates, mixed salt tolerant consortia and tannerysludge). A maximum degradation of 87.6% was observedfor P.aeruginosa compared to tannery sludge (68.5%).
Studies on effect of salinity already showed that P. aerugi-
nosa was effective in adapting to low salt concentrations (>
5% w/v) compared with the other strains reported. Thisfinding was also reflected in the experimental resultsMicrobial Cell Factories  2008, 7:15 http://www.microbialcellfa ctories.com/content/7/1/15

(page number not for citation purposes)obtained from biodegradation of tannery saline wastewa-
ter and confirmed that P.aeruginosa was a suitable working
strain for treatment of tannery effluent of low saline con-
centration.
The results obtained for treatment of tannery saline waste-
water at 4% (w/v) saline condition also showed P. aerugi-
nosa to be an ideal strain. A higher COD removal (of 80%)
was noted as compared with other strains and mixed cul-
ture. At 4% salinity level, although it took two days for
P.aeruginosa to values with adapt as well as achieve 80%
degradability, it turned out to be an effective strain (Fig.
2). Mixed salt tolerant consortia showed 59.8% COD
removal at 4% (w/v) saline concentration. In both 2%
and 4% saline concentrations, mixed consortia did notshow appreciable degradation of tannery effluent. As the
mixed consortia had all the four identified halotolerant
strains, the inhibition in growth/enzyme secretion due to
competition for earlier adaptation on saline wastewater
could have been dominant at low saline concentrations
This 'competition' suppressed the activity of the respective
strains resulting in poor performance in low salt regime.
(Fig. 3 shows the comparative profile of COD removal in
tannery saline wastewater by identified strains and mixed
consortia at 6% (w/v) saline concentration). It was
observed that mixed salt tolerant bacterial consortia effec-
tively degraded tannery saline wastewater with 6% (w/v)
salinity level (83% degradation).
The above data suggest that cumulative salt tolerance
activity of identified isolates in the consortia was pro-
nounced compared with individual activity of respective
strains. This finding further proved that mixed consortia
could be applied effectively for treatment and manage-
ment of moderate strength tannery saline waste stream. (A
comparative COD removal profile for treatment of tan-
nery saline effluent at 8% (w/v) is given in Fig. 4). Analysis
of results showed that E.homiense exhibited a higher COD
removal (90%). Mixed salt tolerant consortia also showed
an appreciable COD removal (80%) at 8% (w/v) salinity
concentration, but not as efficiently as with E.homiense .
The individual efficiency of E.homiense to degrade tannery
saline wastewater could have been inhibited when it was
present in mixed consortia, due to substrate competition
and initial biomass density.
A sudden fall in COD reduction was observed for all the
strains (> 50%) when salinity level increased to 10% (Fig.
5). This indicated that even a smaller increment in salinity
(8 to 10%) could result in adverse effect on treatment effi-
ciency. From the results given in Fig. 5, it could be

(page number not for citation purposes)observed that both E.homiense and mixed consortia exhib-
ited similar COD removal (48%) at 10% salinity concen-
tration. The experimental results of COD removal at 8%
and 10% saline concentration further suggested that
E.homiense employed in this study could be a moderately
halophillic strain. In CETPs, average salt concentration of
tannery wastewater had been found to vary between 2%
and 6% and this covered salt tolerant regime only. The salt
concentration hardly exceeded 8% (w/v) for effluent
released from beam house operations of leather process-
ing units and the identified mixed consortia reported in
this study could be advantageously employed for efficient
biological treatment of the saline waste stream. It could be
observed from Fig(s) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, that the treatment of tan-
nery saline wastewater by natural habitat strains (blank)
was not a feasible option. Efficiency of COD removal was
observed to be less than 50% for different saline concen-
trations viz., 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% (w/v). From Fig(s)
2, 3, 4, 5, it could be observed that the conventional acti-
vated tannery sludge showed a low COD removal com-
pared to the salt tolerant consortia. (Fig. 6 describes the
comparative profile of % COD removal by activated
sludge (tannery) and salt tolerant consortia). From Fig. 6,
it could be observed that as the salinity increased from 2
to 4% (w/v), tannery sludge efficiency reduced to 60%
from 80%; it reduced further to 45% for 6% (w/v) saline
value. The COD removal results for tannery saline waste
stream by natural habitat strains as well as activated tan-
nery sludge proved they were not suitable and that spe-
cialized consortia (salt tolerant) were needed for efficient
treatment. Our experimental findings supported the view
that the identified salt tolerant bacterial consortia be con-sidered as a suitable working culture for efficient biodeg-
radation of tannery saline wastewater.
Conclusion
Salt tolerant bacterial strains ( P.aeruginosa, B.flexus,
E.homiense and S.aureus ) were isolated and identified from
marine sources and tannery saline wastewater. Growth
factors (media, inoculum conc., salinity, pH, temperature
and agitation rate) were optimized for identified strains in
batch experiments. Commercial tannery saline wastewa-
ter was characterized and biologically treated with both
mono and mixed halotolerant bacterial isolates. Compar-

(page number not for citation purposes)ative analysis was done by degrading the tannery saline
wastewater with active biomass sludge obtained from tan-
nery and with natural habitat microbes present in raw tan-nery saline wastewater. The salt concentrations werevaried from 2–10% (w/v) and a good biodegradability oftannery saline wastewater was observed with salt tolerantbacterial mixed consortia (80% COD reduction in 8%
salinity). Increase in salt concentration to 10% resulted in
deterioration of the treatment process and poor CODreduction (60% for mixed consortia). This study sug-gested the possibility of successful application of identi-fied salt tolerant bacterial consortia for efficientdegradation of tannery saline wastewater. Such applica-
tion would compare well with other conventional biolog-
ical treatment processes being used with activated sludgeas a working culture.
