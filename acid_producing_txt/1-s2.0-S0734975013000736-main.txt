its high potential for applications in a wide range of ﬁelds. More speci ﬁcally, the sharp increase in manufacturing
of biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) materials, green alternatives to petroleum-derived plastics, has signi ﬁcant-
ly increased the global interest in lactic acid production. However, higher production costs have hindered thelarge-scale application of PLA because of the high price of lactic acid. Therefore, reduction of lactic acid productioncost through utilization of inexpensive substrates and improvement of lactic acid production and productivity
has become an important goal. Various methods have been employed for enhanced lactic acid production, includ-
ing several bioprocess techniques facilitated by wild-type and/or engineered microbes. In this review, we willdiscuss lactic acid producers with relation to their fermentation characteristics and metabolism. Inexpensive fer-
mentative substrates, such as dairy products, food and agro-industrial wastes, glycerol, and algal biomass alter-
natives to costly pure sugars and food crops are introduced. The operational modes and fermentation methodsthat have been recently reported to improve lactic acid production in terms of concentrations, yields, and produc-tivities are summarized and compared. High cell density fermentation through immobilization and
cell-recycling techniques are also a ddressed. Finally, advances in reco very processes and concluding re-
marks on the future outlook of lactic acid production are presented.

1. Introduction
In recent years, concerns over the microbial production of com-
mercially valuable products have been growing. This is mainly attrib-
uted to escalating global energy and environmental problems, which
have stimulated researchers worldwide to develop methods for pro-ducing almost everything through green methods. Of these, lactic
acid is a most important product that has attracted a great deal of at-
tention due to its widespread applications, mainly in food, chemical,
cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Also, it has great potential
for the production of biodegradable and biocompatible polylactic
acid (PLA) polymers that drive the current market expansion for lac-
tic acid. PLA products can be used in a wide variety of applications
ranging from packaging to ﬁbers and foams. In comparison with pet-
rochemical plastics, PLA production is considered a relatively imma-ture technology at the industrial scale. This is mainly attributed to
the high production cost of lactic acid, which is the starting raw ma-
terial for PLA. Lactic acid production can be achieved either by chem-
ical synthesis routes or fermentative production routes (lactic acid
fermentation). By the chemical synthesis route, a racemic mixture
of
DL-lactic acid is usually produced. On the other hand, fermentative
production routes offer advantages of utilization of cheap renewablesubstrates, low production temperatures, low energy consumption,
and production of optically pure
D-o r L-lactic acid when the appropri-
ate microorganism is selected as the lactic acid producer. Presently,almost all lactic acid produced worldwide comes from the fermenta-
tive production route ( Abdel-Rahman et al., 2011c ).
The demand for lactic acid has been estimated to grow yearly at 5 –8%
(Yadav et al., 2011 ). The annual world market for lactic acid production
was expected to reach 259,000 metric tons by the year 2012 ( Martinez
et al., 2013 ), and is forecasted to reach 367,300 metric tons by the year
2017. The major manufacturers of fermentative lactic acid productionare NatureWorks LLC, which had been wholly owned by Cargill
Incorporated (USA), Purac (The Netherlands), Galactic (Belgium), and
several Chinese companies ( John et al., 2007b). In late 2002, NatureWorks
LLC started the world's ﬁrst full-scale PLA plant in Blair, Nebraska, USA,
capable of producing 140,000 metric tons per year. NatureWorks LLC
entered into a joint venture between Cargill and Teijin Limited of
Japan to become 50 –50 partners in December 2007. This company has
done extensive work on the development of lactic acid-based polymers,
which are of two types —the polydilactide-based resins (NatureWorks
P L A ® ) ,u s e df o rp l a s t i c so rp a c k a g i n g ,a n dt h eI n g e o ™polydilactide-
based ﬁbers that are used in specialty textiles and ﬁbers. PLA resins
have been approved for all food-type applications by the US Food andDrug Administration and European regulatory authorities. Presently,NatureWorks LLC is the leader in PLA technology, and has over 95% of
the current PLA worldwide production capacity. Other manufacturers in-
volved in PLA production such as Toyobo, Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd.,
Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, NEC Corporation, Toyota
Motor Corporation (Japan), Purac Biomaterials, Hycail (The Netherlands),
Futerro and Galactic (Belgium), Cereplast Inc. (USA), FKuR PlasticsCorporation, Biomer Technology Ltd, Stanelco RF Technologies, Uhde
Inventa-Fischer (Germany), and Hisun Industries Co. Ltd and
Snamprogetti (China) account for the remaining capacity ( Jamshidian
et al., 2010 ).
Although the demand for PLA is increasing, its current production
capacity of only 450,000 metric tons per year is dwarfed by the200 million metric tons per year of total plastics produced ( Okano et
al., 2010 ), which results from the high manufacturing cost of raw mate-
rial, that is, lactic acid monomer as mentioned above. Furthermore, the
primary costs associated with lactic acid production include the fer-
mentative substrates of nutrients, expensive nitrogen sources and
sugars required for the cell growth and the fermentation along with
the downstream recovery and puri ﬁcation process. In addition, to pro-
duce high concentration of lactic acid, fermentation processes requirethe pH control in the range of ca. 5 –7 using neutralizing agents during
fermentation, which also increases the costs in terms of acidulation ofthe fermentation broth to regenerate free lactic acid followed by down-
stream steps. To meet recent applications of lactic acid for PLA and to be
commercially viable, overall lactic acid production costs should be at or
below $ 0.8 per kilogram of lactic acid, as the selling price of PLA must
decrease by roughly half of its present price to compete with fossil-
fuel-based plastics ( Okano et al., 2010 ). To this end, a strain for the
industrial lactic acid production should produce more than 100 g/L oflactic acid with a high yield at near maximal theoretical value, a high op-
tical purity of lactic acid (>99%), and a high productivity in cheap media
(Litchﬁeld, 2009 ). In addition, the fermentation process improvements
will lead to enhanced operating ef ﬁciency and yields of lactic acid pro-
duction. Therefore, improvements and engineering of new effective fer-
mentation processes are important to ﬁt the worldwide requirements.
The ef ﬁciency of lactic acid fermentation processes mainly depends
on the lactic acid producer, fermentation substrate, and operational
modes. Lactic acid can be produced from renewable materials by vari-
ous microbial species, including bacteria, fungi, yeast, microalgae, and
cy
anobacteria. Selection of the strain is of great importance, particularly
in terms of high optical purity of lactic acid and high production capac-ity. A major concern in lactic acid fermentation is to reduce the cost of
raw materials and improve the production ef ﬁcacy. Pure sugars and
food crops have been partially replaced by nonfood carbohydrates inthe fermentation industry in recent years. The use of various low-cost878 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902raw materials has been extensively investigated ( Abdel-Rahman et al.,
2011c; Budhavaram and Fan, 2009; Laopaiboon et al., 2010;
Mazumdar et al., 2010; Talukder et al., 2012 ). Another method that re-
duces the cost of lactic acid production is to improve the production,productivity and yield of lactic acid fermentation. Although batch fer-
mentation is the most widely used in lactic acid production, it suffers
from low productivity due to long fermentation times and low cell con-centrations. In addition, substrate and end product inhibition are also
considered major bottlenecks of this fermentation manner. To over-
come such problems, fed-batch fermentation, repeated fermentation,
and continuous fermentation have been investigated. However, each
of these methods has some limitations, and great efforts have been
made to further develop these processes to achieve ef ﬁcient lactic acid
production. Fermentation methods using high cell densities (HCDs)via immobilization or cell recycling have been shown to achieve high
lactic acid productivity. Also, advances in integrated-membrane fer-
mentation reactor systems are a promising technology for future
industrial lactic acid production.
This paper reviews the characteristics of lactic acid producers,
their abilities to utilize different substrates, and the metabolic path-
ways involved in the production of lactic acid. Alternative substrates
to pure sugars and food crops that have been recently used for lactic
acid production are also pointed out. Recent advances in process
engineering, methods for lactic acid production, the limitations of each
method, and how to overcome these limitations are also discussed.
2. Microbial lactic acid producers
Lactic acid can be produced by several microorganisms classi ﬁed
into bacteria, fungi, yeast, cyanobacteria, and algae. Each biocatalyst
has achieved one or more improvements over the others, such as a
broader substrate range, improved yield and productivity, reduction of
nutritional requirements, or improved optical purity of lactic acid. The
use of mixed strains in fermentation may provide useful combinations
of metabolic pathways for the utilization of complex materials and con-
sequently enhance lactic acid production ( Cui et al., 2011; Kleerebezem
and van Loosdrecht, 2007; Nancib et al., 2009; Taniguchi et al., 2004 ).
The genetic-engineering approaches have been exploited in a big way
for the improvement of lactic acid yield and optical purity by various
microbial producers. The reference by Okano et al. (2010) provides
an extensive review of reports on the subject of geneticallyengineered-microorganisms for lactic acid production. In this section,
the characteristics of lactic acid producers and their applicability for
fermentation processes are discussed.
2.1. Bacteria
Lactic acid-producing bacteria include wild-type and engineered
producers. These organisms can be divided into 4 main producers ,
namely, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Bacillus strains, Escherichia coli ,a n d
Corynebacterium glutamicum . In general, bacterial lactic acid fermenta-
tion suffers from several limitations, including (i) production of both
L-a n d D-lactic acid via L-lactate dehydrogenase ( L-LDH) and D-lactate
dehydrogenase ( D-LDH), respectively; (ii) low yield due to byproduct
formation; (iii) use of nutritionally rich medium; and (iv) high risk of
bacteriophage infection that results in cell lysis and subsequent cessa-
tion of lactic acid production ( Budhavaram and Fan, 2009; Litch ﬁeld,
2009; Singh et al., 2006 ). Various studies have investigated methods
to overcome these problems in the ﬁeld of metabolic engineering, i.e.,
(i) improvement of optical purity via the deletion of either D-o r L-LDH
genes ( Kyla-Nikkila et al., 2000 ); (ii) increased lactic acid yields through
reduction of byproduct levels by the deletion of genes encoding pyru-vate formate lyase (formic acid production), alcohol dehydrogenase
(ethanol production), and/or acetate kinase (acetic acid production)
(Zhou et al., 2003b ); (iii) development of bacterial strains, e.g., E. coli ,
producing lactic acid on chemically de ﬁned media ( Zhou et al., 2003a );and (iv) strain improvements for blocking steps in phage life cycle(Allison and Klaenhammer, 1998; Forde and Fitzgerald, 1999 ). Usage
of mixed strains and/or development of phage-resistant strains aresometimes necessary to prevent bacteriophage infection ( Hassan and
Frank, 2001 ).
2.1.1. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB)
LAB constitute a diverse group of Gram-positive microorganisms
that exist within plants, meat, and dairy products and can produce
lactic acid as an anaerobic product of glycolysis with high yield and
high productivity. The optimal growth conditions vary depending
on the producers, since these bacteria can grow in the pH range of
3.5–10.0 and temperature of 5 –45 °C.
The major pathways for the metabolism of hexoses and pentoses by
LAB are indicated in Fig. 1 . LAB are grouped as either homofermentative
or heterofermentative based on the fermentation end product asdescribed in Table 1. Homofermentative LAB possess aldolase en-
zymes and produce lactic acid as the major end product. They areof interest for commercial scale lactic acid production. On the
other hand, heterofermentative LAB produce byproducts besides
lactic acid and, therefore, the maximal yield of lactic acid to glucose
reaches only 0.5 g/g or 1.0 mol/mol ( Abdel-Rahman et al., 2011c ).
Heterofermentative LAB use the alternate pentose monophosphate
pathway, converting 6-carbon sugars (hexoses) to 5-carbon sugars
(pentoses) and carbon dioxide catalyzed by several enzymes
(Fig. 1 ). Then, the resulting pentose is cleaved to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate and acetyl phosphate by phosphoketolase. Mostheterofermentative LAB strains convert the pentose sugars to lactic
acid and byproducts (e.g., acetic acid ) through phosphoketolase pathways
with a maximum lactic acid yield at 0.6 g lactic acid per gram of pentoses.Recently, Enterococcus mundtii QU 25 ( Abdel-Rahman et al., 2011a )a n d
engineered Lactobacillus plantarum (Okano et al., 2009a, 2009b )w e r e
reported to metabolize pentose to lactic acid homofermentatively.
Most LAB, including Lactobacilli , are considered to be safe for
industrial lactic acid production because they have had a long history
of industrial-scale production without adverse health effects on either
consumers or production workers. Commercially important LAB strains,
such as Lactobacillus strains, have been particularly useful due to their
high acid tolerance and their ability to be engineered for selective pro-duction of
D-or L-lactic acid ( Benthin and Villadsen, 1995; Kyla-Nikkila
et al., 2000; Lapierre et al., 1999 ). On the other hand, most LAB species
require complex nutrients, including amino acids, peptides, nucleotides,
and vitamins, for their growth because they lack many biosynthetic ca-
pabilities, which hampers the recovery of lactic acid and increases pro-
duction costs ( Hofvendahl and Hahn-Hägerdal, 2000; Lapierre et al.,
1999; Litch ﬁeld, 2009; Reddy et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2006 ). In addition,
the low fermentation temperature for lactic acid production required by
most LAB strains not only increases contamination risks, but also ham-
pers its use in the simultaneous sacchari ﬁcation and fermentation (SSF)
of lignocellulosic biomass using hydrolytic enzymes at higher optimaltemperatures for sacchari ﬁcation than that required for cell growth of
LAB strains.
Alkaliphilic or thermotolerant LAB strains may be promising pro-
ducers of lactic acid due to their tolerance to high pH temperature levelsthat would minimize contamination problems during processing(Calabia et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010 ).Calabia et al. (2011) isolated an
alkaliphilic Halolactibacillus halophilus from a marine environment
that produced 65.8 g/L of
L-lactic acid at pH 9.0. Although lactic acid
production by LAB is very ef ﬁcient, further improvements in the strain
(especially, high acid tolerance) and the process can help to make
it more cost-competitive with petroleum-based polymers for PLA
production.
2.1.2. Bacillus strains
Lactic acid production has also been reported by some Bacillus
species, including Bacillus coagulans ,Bacillus stearothermophilus ,Bacillus879 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902licheniformis ,Bacillus subtilis ,a n d Bacillus sp. In comparison to LAB,
Bacillus spp. have several potential improvements to lactic acid produc-
tion that may help for the reduction of costs in lactic acid fermentation
as follows: (i) Bacillus ssp. can grow and produce lactic acid by using
mineral salt medium with few nitrogen sources instead of expensivemedia ( Q. Wang et al., 2011 ); (ii) alkaliphilic strains such as Bacillus
sp. WL-S20, isolated by Meng et al. (2012) ,p r o d u c e d
L-lactic acid at a
concentration of 225 g/L and a yield of 0.993 g/g in fed-batch fermenta-
tion at pH 9.0, which would reduce a risk of the contamination during
fermentation; and (iii) Bacillus ssp. can produce lactic acid in thermal
fermentation ( ≥50 °C). These characteristics should give Bacillus spp.several advantages over other bacteria. First, costs associated with thecoolant water after medium sterilization would decrease. In addi-
tion, use of Bacillus spp. would enable the SSF of lignocellulosic bio-
mass with cellulase at an optimum temperature ( Budhavaram and
Fan, 2009; Maas et al., 2008a; Ou et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2006 )a n de n -
able open fermentation using nonsterilized media at higher tempera-tures than 40 °C ( Qin et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010b ). Open
fermentation has been reported using thermotolerant Bacillus strains, in-
cluding B. coagulans (Ou et al., 2009, 2011; Patel et al., 2006; Rosenberg et
al., 2005; Sakai and Ezaki, 2006 ),B. licheniformis (Wang et al., 2011b; Sakai

are able to grow and ferment the hexoses and pentoses in lignocellulosic
biomass to lactic acid. B. coagulans 36D1 was reported to utilize pentose
sugar via the pentose –phosphate pathway, which maximizes the yield
of lactic acid up to 1.0 g/g-consumed sugar ( Patel et al., 2006).
2.1.3. E. coli
Screening for superior lactic acid producers from natural sources is
time consuming and laborious. Therefore, recent studies have appliedengineering methods for achieving better fermentation ef ﬁciency by
using E. coli strains because they can rapidly metabolize hexose and
pentose sugars, have simple nutritional requirement, and are easy to
be genetically manipulated. Wild-type E. coli generally produces a mix-
ture of ethanol and several organic acids (lactic acid, acetic acid, succinicacid, and formic acid) to accommodate reducing equivalents generated
during glycolysis ( Clark, 1989; de Graef et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2003a ).
To improve lactic acid production, E. coli strains have been engineered
in the ﬁeld of metabolic engineering ( Chang et al., 1999; Kochhar et
al., 1992; Taguchi and Ohta, 1991; Zhou et al., 2003a ). Several studies
reported the use of engineered E. coli strains for lactic acid production
from glucose ( Chang et al., 1999; Dien et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2003a,
b, 2005; Zhu et al., 2007 ), xylose ( Dien et al., 2001 ), sucrose ( Wang et
al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2005 ), and glycerol ( Mazumdar et al., 2010 ). How-
ever, the productivity ( ≤1.04 g/L/h), ﬁnal concentration ( ≤62.5 g/L),
and tolerance of lactic acid by engineered E. coli strains were much
lower than that achieved with many LAB and Bacillus spp ( Chang et
al., 1999; Portnoy et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2003a ). Thus, the major prob-
lem to be addressed is to realize high ef ﬁcient lactic acid production
using inexpensive resources.
More recently, direct production of PLA and its copolymers from glu-
cose by engineered E. coli through a 1-step fermentation process was
reported by the expression of respective genes encoding propionateCoA-transferase and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase for the ef ﬁcient
generation of lactyl-CoA and incorporation of lactyl-CoA into the poly-mer, respectively ( Jung et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010 ). However, it was
necessary to use an inducer for the expression of the introduced genesand to feed succinic acid for proper cell growth. Jung and Lee (2011)
reported further engineering E. coli JLXF5. In pH-stat fed-batch fermenta-
tion, PLA and a copolymer of p oly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-39.6 mol% lac-
tate) having a molecular weight o f 141,000 Da could be produced at
20 g/L polymer with a 43 wt.% content of dry cells from glucose in a
chemically de ﬁned
medium without adding the inducer and succinate.
2.1.4. C. glutamicum
C. glutamicum is a Gram-positive, fast-growing, aerobic, non-
sporulating, nonmotile, saprophytic bacterium that has been reportedto excrete several organic acids at small amounts under oxygen-limited
conditions ( Yukawa et al., 2007 ). Several engineered C. glutamicum
strains have been reported to produce combined organic acids (lacticacid, succinic acid, and acetic acid) under oxygen deprivation from var-
ious sugars, such as
L-arabinose and D-glucose ( Kawaguchi et al., 2008 );
D-xylose and D-glucose ( Kawaguchi et al., 2006 );D-glucose, D-xylose,
and D-cellobiose ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ); and L-arabinose ( Sasaki et al.,
2009 ). By knockout of the L-LDH gene and heterologous expression
of the D-LDH encoding gene from Lactobacillus bulgaricus , engineered
C. glutamicum produced 17.9 g/L of D-lactic acid (optical purity
>99.9%) after 16 h of fermentation, which was 32.3% higher than the
lactic acid production of the parental strain ( Jia et al., 2011 ). Use of
Corynebacteria under oxygen-deprived conditions at an HCD is advanta-
geous since energy is primarily channeled to lactic acid production and
n o tc e l lg r o w t h( Inui et al., 2004 ).Okino et al. (2005) reported a direct
correlation between cell concentration and acid production rates,even at elevated cell densities, and achieved
L-lactic acid productivities
of 42.9 g/L/h at a cell concentration of 60 g dry cells/L in mineral medi-um for more than 360 h. Similarly, using an HCD in mineral salt medi-
um with glucose, up to 120 g/L
D-lactic acid (optical purity ≥99.9%)was produced in fed-batch fermentation within 30 h by engineered
C. glutamicum ΔldhA/pCRB204 with expression of D-LDH-encoding
genes derived from Lactobacillus delbrueckii (Okino et al., 2008 ). There-
fore, C. glutamicum is a suitable bacterium that can achieve high lac-
tic acid production without the requirement for complex nutritionalmedia. On the other hand, low lactic acid yield due to formation of acetic
acid and succinic acid also needs to be addressed. Recently, Song et al.
(2012) succeeded in developing an engineered C. glutamicum strain
that can produce a lactate-based polymer, poly(LA-co-3HB), with highLA fractions (96.8 mol%), from glucose through successive enzymatic
reactions. These include generation of
D-lactyl-CoA by D-LDH and
propionyl-CoA transferase, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA generation catalyzedbyβ-ketothiolase and NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase,
and copolymerization of
D-lactyly-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA cata-
lyzed by lactate polymerizing enzyme. The functional expression of
these enzymes led to the production of poly(LA-co-3HB) with high LA
fractions (96.8 mol%).
2.2. Fungi
Several species of the genus Rhizopus , especially R. oryzae ,h a v e
become the focus of studies of the production of optically pure L-lactic
acid ( Bai et al., 2008; Taskin et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011 ).Rhizopus
strains have many advantages compared to lactic acid-producing bacte-
ria, including their amylolytic characteristics that enable them to utilize
various starchy biomasses without prior sacchari ﬁcation ( Jin et al.,
2003 ), low nutrient requirements ( Bulut et al., 2004; Marták et al.,
2003; Oda et al., 2003 ), low-cost downstream process due to their ﬁla-
mentous or pellet growth that makes its separation from fermentationbroth easier than that in bacteria or yeast ( Zhang et al., 2007 ), and
fungal biomass as a valuable fermentation byproduct. The differentmorphological forms of fungal growth (extended ﬁlamentous form,
mycelial mats, pellets, or clumps) have a signi ﬁcant effect on the
rheology of the fermentation broth, the oxygen supply, and the
level of lactic acid production. Fungal growth in small pellets is the
preferable morphology for industrial fermentations because it en-
hances rheology and mass transfer in fermentation broth and can
be utilized for long operations using repeated batch fermentation
(Maneeboon et al., 2010 ). Several studies attempted to use immobi-
lization techniques for
L-lactic acid production with R. oryzae (Dong
et al., 1996; Efremenko et al., 2006 ); however, this technique is
time consuming due to the requirement for entrapment of fungalcells on matrixes and is limited in volume.
Lactic acid production by Rhizopus strains using different renewable
resources, including molasses, raw starch materials, and lignocellulosic
biomass, has been reported by many authors ( Bai et al., 2008; Maas
et al., 2006, 2008b; Miura et al., 2004; Park et al., 2004; Saito et al.,2012; Taherzadeh et al., 2003; Taskin et al., 2012; Thongchul et al.,
2010 ). However, there are some limitations that should be controlled
for optimal lactic acid production by Rhizopus strains, such as produc-
tion of undesirable byproducts, particularly ethanol and fumaric acid
(Litchﬁeld, 2009; Magnuson and Lasure, 2004; Vink et al., 2010 ), re-
quirements of aeration for more than the oxygen transfer rate of 0.3 gO
2/L/h ( T. Liu et al., 2006; Y. Liu et al., 2006 ), and the ﬁlamentous nature
of the Rhizopus strains that create potential issues in mass transfer, bulk
mixing, and lactic acid recovery ( Bai et al., 2003a ).
2.3. Yeasts
One major economic hurdle for commercial lactic acid production
is the costly recovery procedure required to separate and purify the
product from the fermentation broth. Yeasts have received much
attention recently as lactic acid producers because they can grow in
mineral media that can facilitate further recovery of lactic acid
(Dequin and Barre, 1994 ). In addition, yeasts can tolerate pH values
as low as 1.5, which strongly enables the establishment of non-881 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902neutralizing fermentation. Moreover, this low pH eliminates the re-
generation of precipitated lactate (calcium lactate), which would
lead to decreases in the cost of neutralizing agents (i.e., calcium
carbonate) ( Praphailong and Fleet, 1997 ). Although most wild-type
yeasts naturally produce little lactic acid as a major fermentationproduct, much effort has been made to develop engineered yeasts
for lactic acid production. It is possible to obtain lactic acid productionat high yields by partial or full replacement of ethanol production
with deletion of pyruvate decarboxylase and/or pyruvate dehydroge-
nase activities ( Bianchi et al., 2001 ).
Different yeast genera have been engineered to produce lactic acid, in-
cluding Saccharomyces (Ishida et al., 2005; Saitoh et al., 2005; Tokuhiro
et al., 2009; Valli et al., 2006 ),Zygosacchromyces (Branduardi et al.,
2006 ),Candida (Osawa et al., 2009 ),Pichia (Ilmen et al., 2007), and
Kluyveromyces (Bianchi et al., 2001). Recent advances in yeast engineer-
ing have focused on the use of a variety of sugars other than glucose
and xylose. Tokuhiro et al. (2008) engineered a Saccharomyces cerevisiae
strain that expresses the β-glucosidase gene derived from Aspergillus
aculeatus in order to allow the yeast to utilize cellobiose as a substrate.
The resulting engineered strain successfully produced approximately80 g/L lactic acid from approximately 100 g/L cellobiose, with a yield of
0.70 g/g and a maximum production rate of 2.8 g/L/h. Further studies
on lactic acid production from oligosaccharides and polysaccharides via
integration of respective genes into the genome of yeast strains are
required.
2.4. Microalgae and cyanobacteria
With the discovery of global warming, there is growing interest
in processes that couple CO
2capture to valuable chemical synthesis
through the use of photosynthetic microorganisms. Photosynthetic
microorganisms (i.e., algae and cyanobacteria) offer an alternative
lactic acid production approach and would allow carbohydrate feed-
stock costs to be eliminated. Some microalgae have the ability to con-
vert the starch they accumulated under light and aerobic conditions
into organic matter, such as lactic acid, ethanol, acetic acid, and formic
acid under dark and anaerobic conditions ( Hirayama and Ueda, 2004;
Oost et al., 1989 ). A few papers have reported the levels of lactic acid
production by microalgal species, including Scenedesmus obliquus
strain D3 ( Hirt et al., 1971 ) and Nannochlorum sp. 26A4 ( Hirayama
and Ueda, 2004 ).Hirayama and Ueda (2004) reported 26 g/L D-lactic
acid production with an optical purity of 99.8% by Nannochlorum sp.
26A4 from their starch (40% content per dry weight) at yield of 70%
under dark and anaerobic conditions.
Cyanobacteria possess several advantages, including their photosyn-
thetic capabilities, simple input requirements (namely, sunlight, CO 2,
and water with few required mineral nutrients), their capacity for ge-netic engineering, and carbon-neutral applications that could be lever-
aged to address global climate change concerns ( Ducat et al., 2011 ).
Niederholtmeyer et al. (2010) engineered Synechococcus elongatus
PCC7942 via expression of genes encoding invertase, glucose- and
fructose-facilitated diffusion transporter,
L-LDH derived from E. coli ,
and lactate transporter, and the resulting strain produced lactic acid inthe extracellular broth at 600 μM.Angermayr et al. (2012) introduced
an
L-LDH gene derived from B. subtilis into the genome of Synechocystis
sp. PCC6803 and reported the production of 3.2 mM lactic acid by theengineered strain after 2 weeks.
3. Alternative fermentation substrates for lactic acid production
Raw material cost is one of the major factors in the economic pro-
duction of lactic acid. Pure sugars or edible crops have been a tradi-
tional substrate for lactic acid production that is advantageous in
obtaining a pure lactic acid product and lowering costs of pretreat-
ment and recovery. Since substrate cost cannot be reduced by process
scale-up, extensive studies are currently underway to search for novelsubstrates for lactic acid production. Various materials have been con-
sidered as attractive alternative substrates and renewable resources, in-
cluding byproducts of agricultural industries, food industries, and
natural unutilized biomasses such as starchy biomass, lignocellulosic
biomass, whey, yogurt, glycerol, and algal biomass.
3.1. Starchy materials, lignocellulosic biomass, agro-industrial and
food wastes
Recently, lactic acid has been produced from a variety of carbohy-
drates, including starchy and lignocellulosic biomasses, depending onthe substrate availability in the producing country ( Litchﬁeld, 2009;
Vink et al., 2007 ). The pretreatment and sacchari ﬁcation of raw mate-
rials by physicochemical and enzymatic treatment are one of the bottle-
neck processes for cost-effective lactic acid production ( Abdel-Rahman
et al., 2011c ). Direct fermentation of starchy biomass has been demon-
strated to produce lactic acid; however, further development is still nec-
essary before these processes are commercially feasible. The reference
byReddy et al. (2008) provides an extensive review of reports on the
subject of using starchy biomass as a substrate for lactic acid production.
Lignocellulosic biomass is another abundant carbohydrate source
that has recently drawn a lot of interest for lactic acid production.
The use of this type of biomass would help to overcome many
environmental problems and must not cause food problems; how-
ever, it is more dif ﬁcult to ferment lignocellulosic biomass than
starchy biomass to lactic acid. This is because lignocelluloic biomasscontains cellulose as the main component. Cellulose is a persistent
polymer, and its degradation requires physicochemical pretreatments
and multi-enzymatic reactions ( Okano et al., 2010 ). For example, corn
stover or cobs, sugarcane bagasse, and wood processing waste are alter-native substrates used for lactic acid production after pretreatment and
chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis ( Cui et al., 2011; L. Wang et al., 2010;
Laopaiboon et al., 2010 ). Lactic acid production from different sub-
strates using several fermentation modes are described in Table 2 .W e
have recently reviewed the composition and the utilization of lignocel-lulosic biomass for lactic acid production and pointed out the challenges
that must be overcome for their effective utilization ( Abdel-Rahman
et al., 2011c ). Different organic wastes that used as substrate for lactic
acid production are also summarized in Table 2 .
3.2. Dairy products
Dairy industries all over the world generate ample amounts of whey
from milk processing for various manufactured products. Whey is a
byproduct in wastewater discharged through the cheese production
process, and its disposal is currently a major pollution problem for the
dairy industry. Whey is a potent and suitable raw material for lactic
acid production because it consists of lactose, protein, fats, water-
soluble vitamins, mineral salts, and other essential nutrients for micro-
bial growth ( Panesar et al., 2007 ). Nevertheless, LAB require supple-
mentation with sources of amino acids and vitamins to the mediumbecause they do not have suf ﬁcient proteolytic enzyme activities to
utilize milk proteins in whey ( Miller et al., 2011 ). In addition,
deproteinized whey containing mainly lactose has been extensively
studied for lactic acid production ( Büyükkileci and Harsa, 2004; Kim
et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007; Schepers et al., 2002, 2006 ).
Theoretically, 4 mol of lactic acid should be produced from 1 mol
of lactose through a homofermentative pathway after the cleavageof lactose to 1 mol of glucose and 1 mol of galactose ( Fig. 1 ). As
shown in Table 3 , different strains have been used for the production
of
lactic acid from whey, including Lactobacillus helveticus ,Lb.
plantarum ,Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ,Lactobacillus acidophilus ,
Lactobacillus casei ,Lactoccocus lactis ,a n d Kluyveromyces marxianus .
Lactic acid production from the whey in conventional batch fer-mentation exhibited a long lag period, which required greater fer-
mentor capacity and increased operational costs ( Zayed and882 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902Winter, 1995 ). In addition, the produced lactic acid has an inhibitory
effect in whey fermentation that can be alleviated to a certain extent
by conducting fermentation in a continuous dialysis process in a
hollow ﬁber fermentor ( VickRoy et al., 1983a ) or in an electrodialysis
system with a monopolar or dipolar membrane ( Bazinet, 2004;
Hongo et al., 1986 ). Continuous fermentation of whey has resulted in
high productivity and does not require high-volume fermentors(Aeschlimann and von Stockar, 1991; Boyaval et al., 1987; Roy et al.,
1987 ).
The market for yogurt has also grown rapidly over the past few
years. Consequently, rejects of damaged or expired yogurt create a
huge amount of waste products. Yogurt is usually sweetened with
additional sugars, such as sucrose and glucose, which would result
in higher lactic acid production than cheese whey containing fewer
sugars. Lb. casei ATCC 393 achieved a bioconversion of total sugars of
around 44% to 25.9 g/L of lactic acid at a yield of 0.9 g/g and productivityof 0.76 g/L/h in a pH-controlled batch fermentation process using yo-
gurt whey ( Alonso et al., 2010 ); however, mixed sugar utilization oflactose, glucose, and sucrose is a major problem that has to be
addressed for effective utilization of yogurt whey.
3.3. Glycerol
The biodiesel industry is one of the most important technologi-
cal biomass-based platforms because it has been considered as an
environmentally friendly fuel. Its production reached more than
11.1 million tons in 2008 with an annual growing production rate
of close to 8% –10% ( Posada et al., 2012a ). Different kinds of edible
and inedible vegetable oils and algae oils have been widely usedfor biodiesel production worldwide. Consequently, overproduction
of raw glycerol as a byproduct is a continuous challenge, leading
to byproduct wastes obtained at a weight ratio of 1:10 (glycerol:
biodiesel) ( Posada et al., 2012b ). Therefore, effective glycerol utili-
zation as a cheap raw material would solve both economic andenvironmental drawbacks. Several microorganisms were reported
to convert glycerol to lactic acid, including Klebsiella ,Clostridium ,Table 2
Lignocellulosic, agro-industrial and food waste materials used for the production of lactic acid.

Kishimoto (2008) developed a method for producing lactic acid from
glycerol using Achromobacter denitri ﬁcans NBRC 12669. However, only
3.9 g/L lactic acid was produced from 9.4 g/L consumed glycerol. A com-
mon characteristic of glycerol metabolism by wild type E. coli under ei-
ther anaerobic or microaerobic conditions is the heterofermentationbehavior with the production of ethanol as the primary product andthe negligible amount of lactic acid production ( Dharmadi et al., 2006;
Durnin et al., 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2008; Murarka et al., 2008 ).Hong
et al. (2009) isolated E. coli AC-521, which produced 56.8 g/L and
85.8 g/L lactic acid with few byproducts in batch and fed-batch fermen-tations, respectively ( Table 4 ). Recently, lactic acid production from
glycerol using engineered E. coli h a sb e e ni n v e s t i g a t e da ss h o w ni n
Table 4 .Mazumdar et al. (2010) engineered a homofermentative route
for
D-lactate production by overexpressing pathways involved in the
conversion of glycerol to D-lactic acid and by disrupting the pathways
leading to the synthesis of competing by-products. Using thatengineered strain, 32 g/L of
D-lactic acid was produced from 40 g/L glyc-
erol in batch fermentation with a minimal medium ( Table 4 ). Based on
the aforementioned study, process design, simulation, and assessment
of optically pure D-lactic acid production from raw glycerol using
engineered E. coli strains were reported by Posada et al. (2012a,
2012b). Higher concentrations of D- l a c t i ca c i du pt o1 1 1 . 5g / L
(Mazumdar et al. (2010); Tian et al., 2012 )o r L- l a c t i ca c i du pt o5 0g / L
(Mazumdar et al., 2013 ) were achieved in fed-batch fermentation
(Table 4 ).
3.4. Microalgae
Microalgae have been recently utilized as the substrates for fermen-
tative lactic acid production. In comparison to lignocellulosic biomass,microalgae do not contain lignin which simpli ﬁes its conversion into
fermentable sugars ( Nguyen et al., 2012a,b ). In addition, it can grow al-
most anywhere and has an extremely short harvesting cycle of approx-
imately 1 –10 days ( Schenk et al., 2008 ). The green microalga
Hydrodictyon reticulum contains 47.5% reducing sugars, including 35%
glucose, and has been used as a substrate for the production of
L-lactic
acid by Lactobacillus paracasei LA104 or D-lactic acid by Lactobacillus
coryniformis spp. torquenes [Table 4 ](Nguyen et al., 2012 a,b ). Through
SSF with cellulase, cellobiase, and amylase, H. reticulum achieved an
L-lactic acid concentration of 37.1 g/L at a yield of 0.46 g/g algae and a
productivity of 1.03 g/L/h [ Table 4 ](Nguyen et al., 2012a ). In addition,
Talukder et al. (2012) reported the extraction of lipids from themicroalgae Nannochloropsis salina and used a lipid-free microalgae hy-
drolysate (containing glucose and xylose) as a substrate for fermenta-tive lactic acid production by Lactobacillus pentosus with a lactic acid
yield of 0.93 g/g and a productivity of 0.45 g/L/h ( Table 4 ). Further stud-
ies, especially those associated with the pretreatment of microalgae, are
required in order to achieve effective lactic acid fermentation from such
a highly abundant biomass.
4. Advances in fermentation processes for enhanced lactic acid
production
Selection of fermentation processes may vary with respect to the
type and nature of substrate, microbial growth, and viscosity of fer-mentation broth. In the present section, fermentation processes and
their developments for enhanced fermentative lactic acid production
are described. This includes batch, fed-batch, repeated, and continu-
ous fermentations. The advantages and disadvantages of these fer-mentation modes are described in Table 5 .
4.1. Batch fermentation
Batch fermentation is the most simple and commonly used fermen-
tation process, where all carbon substrates and other components are
not added during fermentation, except for neutralizing agents for pH
control. This closed system has advantages in reducing the risk of con-
tamination and obtaining high lactic acid concentrations in comparison
to other fermentation methods ( Hofvendahl and Hahn-Hägerdal, 2000 ).
On the other hand, batch fermentation suffers from low cell concentra-tions due to limited levels of nutrients and low productivity mainly be-cause of either substrate and/or product inhibition. Kinetic studies on
lactic acid production showed that the ﬁnal lactic acid concentration in-
creases with an increase in the initial glucose concentration as high as200 g/L ( Goncalves et al., 1991; Kadam et al., 2006; Yun et al., 2003 ).
As shown in Table 6 ,Moon et al. (2012) reported the highest lactic
acid concentration in batch fermentation by Lb. paracasei subsp.
paracasei CB2121 —up to 192 g/L of lactic acid from 200 g/L glucose.
4.1.1. Fermentation methods
Different fermentation methods were applied in a batch fermenta-
tion mode, including SSF, separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF),
use of mixed culture or open fermentation to improve lactic acid pro-duction from different substrates as shown in Table 6 . The SSF method
offers various advantages over SHF, such as the use of a single-reaction

al. (2008) reported a higher lactic acid yield of 0.97 g/g using SSF than
that obtained using SHF (0.81 g/g) from recycled paper sludge withLactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC7469. Moreover, the fermentation step of
SHF is preceded by a prolonged period of separate enzymatic hydrolysisthat decreases the real productivity.
Improvement of batch fermentation was also reported with a mixed
culture. Cui et al. (2011) used mixed strains of Lb. rhamnosus andLacto-
bacillus brevis for the consumption of both cellulose- and hemicellulose-
derived sugars from corn stover. During SSF using an NaOH-treated
corn stover by mixed fermentation, an improved lactic acid yield of
0.70 g/g was obtained, which was approximately 18.6% and 29.6%
higher than that obtained from single strains of Lb. rhamnosus and Lb.
brevis, respectively [ Table 6 ](Cui et al., 2011 ). Similarly, 81 g/L of lactic
acid was produced from cassava bagasse via the SSF method by mixed
fermentation of Lb. casei and Lb. delbrueckii (John et al., 2006 ).Nancib
et al. (2009) reported a higher lactic acid concentration of 60.3 g/L
with the mixed strains of Lb. casei subsp. rhamnosus NRRL-B445 and
Lc. lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 19435 as compared to those obtained by
the single strains alone (53 and 46 g/L, respectively).
As shown in most studies stated in Tables 2 −4a n d6 , various strains
of lactic acid producers are applied in fermentation using sterile media
with lignocellulosic or waste materials. However, it is economically un-
favorable to use autoclaving for sterilization of indigenous microorgan-
isms and to inoculate other pure lactic acid-producing strains since it
is difﬁcult to metabolize the complex carbohydrate compositions by
single strain ( Sakai et al., 2004b ). Therefore, nonsterile (open) fermen-
tation has received more attention for lactic acid production not only for
utilizing complex carbohydrate materials but also for its additional ad-
vantages in avoiding the Maillard reaction and formation of furfural
compounds during sterilization, lowering energy consumption and
equipment requirement, simplifying the fermentation process, and
saving labor ( Zhang et al., 2008a; Sakai et al., 2004a,b, 2006 ). Several
studies have focused on enhancement of lactic acid optical purity inopen fermentation by complex natural microbial composition ( Ennahar
et al., 2003; Payot et al., 1999; Sakai et al., 2004b ). Variations in condi-
t i o n sa n dm e t h o d so ff e e d i n gs u b s t r a t ei no p e nf e r m e n t a t i o nh a v ebeen shown to affect the microbial community structure and conse-
quently the optical purity of lactic acid ( Ennahar et al., 2003; Payot
et al., 1999 ). Controlling pH in the fermentation broth has been reported
to suppress the growth of indigenous bacteria for open
D-lactic acid fer-
mentation from rice bran powder. With the pH maintained at 5.0, Lb.
delbrueckii IFO 3202 produced 28 g/L D-lactic acid from 100 g/L rice
bran at a yield of 0.78 g/g and optical purity of 95% ( Tanaka et al.,
2006). Zhang et al., (2008a) reported that the optical purity of lactic
acid was much higher at uncontrolled pH (82%), acidic pH (5.0, 80%),or alkaline pH (8.0, 72%) than that at neutral pH (6.0, 30% and 7.0, 20%)
using kitchen wastes in open fermentation. Moreover, increasing the
fermentation temperature from 35 °C to 45 °C at pH 7.0 enhanced the
optical purity from 20% to 66%. Some researchers suggested that an
unsterile feedstock should be used to assure economic viability. Such
new fermentation methods can add signi ﬁcant value to the economy of
batch fermentation for lactic acid production.
4.1.2. Factors affecting batch fermentation ef ﬁciency
Several factors were reported to improve lactic acid production
efﬁcacy including nitrogen sources, pH and neutralizing agents and
aeration ( Table 6 ). These factors are brie ﬂy discussed as follows.
Many studies on lactic acid production have reported that the ad-
dition of several nutrients in media and supplementation of nitrogen
sources leads to higher production of lactic acid. In addition, selecting
a suitable low-cost nutrient for the medium has usually been consid-
ered a major aspect for improvement and development of lactic acid
production ( Tinoi et al., 2005 ). Food wastes with whey are utilized
not only as carbon sources for lactic acid production but also organicnitrogen sources ( Panesar et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2010 ).Rivas et al.
(2004) achieved a high lactic acid productivity of 2.38 g/L/h from
glucose by Lb. rhamnosus using the biomass of Debaryomyces hansenii
derived from xylitol production and corn steep liquor as the nitrogensources. Substitution of corn steep liquor for yeast extract achieved
an
L-lactic acid concentration, yield, and productivity of 115.1 g/L,
0.96 g/g, and 4.58 g/L/h, respectively, in batch fermentation byLb. rhamnosus CGMCC 1466 ( Yu et al., 2008 ).Liu et al. (2010)
reported that malt sprout and corn steep liquor have a more sig-niﬁcant effects on
L-lactic acid production by Lb. plantarum As.1.3,
in which a higher yield of 0.98 g/g and a higher maximum pro-ductivity of 13.0 g/L/h were obtained than those obtained with
MRS medium (0.87 g/g and 10.0 g/L/h, respectively). Furthermore,
chicken feather hydrolysate exhibited a higher lactic acid production
(38.5 g/L) and yield (7.7 g/g nitrogen source) than yeast extract
(33.2 g/L and 6.6 g/g nitrogen source, respectively) and ammoniumsulfate (28.5 g/L and 5.8 g/g nitrogen source, respectively) from molas-
ses by R. oryzae TS-61 ( Taskin et al., 2012 ).
Increased undissociated lactic acid in accordance with decreasing
pH due to lactic acid production is considered to inhibit the fermenta-
tion of several lactic acid producers. Therefore, trapping the undissoci-
ated lactic acid during fermentation as lactate salt by the addition of
neutralizing agents, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,
calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, or ammonium solution, would
partially overcome such inhibition and improve fermentation ef ﬁcacy
as shown in Table 6 (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2011a,b; Adsul et al., 2007;
Qin et al., 2010; Tashiro et al., 2011 ).B. subtilis CH1 alsS produced
106 g/L of
L-lactic acid from glucose with a productivity of 0.54 g/L/h
at a pH of 7.0 controlled by potassium hydroxide ( Romero-Garcia
et al., 2009 ). At a pH of 6.5 controlled by the addition of sodium hydrox-
ide, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei CHB2121 ef ﬁciently produced high

bMaximum lactic acid productivity.886 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902concentrations of L-lactic acid at 192 g/L with a productivity of
3.99 g/L/h, yield of 0.96 g/g, and optical purity of 96.6% from 200 g/L
glucose [ Table 6 ](Moon et al., 2012 ). Moreover, some studies reported
that neutralizing agents could enhance lactic acid yield and productivityin batch fermentation ( Karp et al., 2011; Nakano et al., 2012; Qin et al.,
2010; Tashiro et al., 2011 ). We obtained higher
D-lactic acid productiv-
ity of 1.67 g/L/h using NH 4OH than 1.3 g/L/h using NaOH (1.3 g/L/h) by
Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis QU 41 ( Tashiro et al., 2011 ).Nakano et al.
(2012) reported that divalent cation (Ca2+) is better than monovalent
cation (Na+and NH3+) as a neutralizing agent for lactic acid produc-
tion in SSF by Lb. delbruecki JCM1106 from broken rice ( Table 6 ).
Aeration exerts a remarkable effect on lactic acid production by
some strains, including Bacillus and E. coli (Qin et al., 2010; Zhu et al.,
2007 ). Without aeration, lactic acid production by Bacillus sp. is limited
due to its low biomass, while too much aeration results in the formationof wasteful byproducts ( Qin et al., 2010 ). To enhance fermentation ef ﬁ-
cacy in batch fermentation, a 2-stage aeration control method wasemployed by a few researchers ( Chang et al., 1999; Qin et al., 2010;
Z h ue ta l . ,2 0 0 7 ). In this method, aeration and agitation were controlled
during the cell growth stage at the beginning of fermentation to in-
crease biomass, and the aeration was then ceased. By applying such a
method, Qin et al. (2010) improved lactic acid yield and signi ﬁcantly re-
duced byproduct formation using Bacillus sp. Na-2 ( Table 6 ).
4.2. Fed-batch fermentation
Concentrations of substrate higher than the critical level cause sub-
strate inhibition on strains, such as cell lysis and long lag phase, whichwould result in decreases in the fermentation rate and sugar utilization
(Ding and Tan, 2006 ). To reduce substrate inhibition, fed-batch fermen-
tation is thought to be a better fermentation system to maintain thesubstrate concentration at a low level by feeding nutrients to the
fermentation broth, compared to batch and continuous fermentation
(Abdel-Rahman et al., 2011c ). In fed-batch fermentation, the substrate
is fed continuously or sequentially to the fermentor without the remov-
al of fermentation broth ( Ding and Tan, 2006 ). It is especially advan-
tageous when high substrate concentrations affect cell growth andproductivity ( Lee et al., 1999; Roukas and Kotzekidou, 1998 ). However,
it still does not address severe product inhibition resulting from accu-mulating high lactic acid product ( Table 5 ). To maximize the product
concentration in fed-batch fermentation, several factors should betaken into consideration, including times and terms of feeding the sub-
strate, the substrate concentration to be maintained in the fermentation
broth, and how to feed the substrate (the feeding methods). It is rather
difﬁcult to perform trial and error tests with so many “open-ended ”
variables that may play key roles in the overall performance of thefed-batch fermentation. Several innovative fed-batch fermentation
methods have been developed for lactic production ( Table 7 ).
Common feeding methods include intermittent, constant, and ex-
ponential feeding as shown in Table 7. Pulse-feeding methods are
easy to apply without much labor achieving high lactic acid produc-tion ( L. Wang et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2012; Okino et al., 2008; Y. Liu
et al., 2006 ).Ding and Tan (2006) employed several fed-batch feed-
ing methods for
L-lactic acid by Lb. casei LA-04-1 as summarized and
compared in Table 7. By exponential feeding of glucose solution
(850 g/L) and yeast extract (1%), a high L-lactic acid concentration
of 180 g/L with a productivity of 2.14 g/L/h was obtained; thesevalues were 56.5% and 59.7% higher, respectively, than those achieved
by batch fermentation. Up to 210 g/L of lactic acid at a yield of 0.97 g/g
and a productivity of 2.2 g/L/h was obtained by continuous feeding of
glucose ( Bai et al., 2003b ). pH-controlled fed-batch fermentation by
Lb. lactis BME5-18 M was developed by several authors (Bai et al.,
2004; Zhang et al., 2010 ), maintaining the glucose concentration of the
fermentation broth at a speci ﬁc value ( Table 7 ).Maas et al. (2008a)
reported a novel process in which the alkaline substrate of lime-
treated wheat straw was automatically fed into the fermentation brothnot only as a carbon source but also to adjust the pH ( Table 7 ). The
performance of fed-batch fermentation by control the residual glucoseconcentration at constant was more effective at maintaining microbial
activity ( Li et al., 2010). Li et al. (2010) designed a high-performance
glucose controller integrated with the fermentor, and achieved 170 g/Lof
L-lactic acid production by glucose feedback-controlled fed-batch
fermentation with Lb. rhamnosus LA-04-1. This result was superior to
that obtained either by pulse feeding or by feeding with a constant rate.
Equipment and labor could be reduced by using SSF-fed-batch
fermentation in a single reactor. Romani et al. (2008) achieved pro-
duction of 37.8 g lactic acid/100 g biosludge at a productivity
of 0.87 g/L/h from cellulosic biosludge by Lb. rhamnosus CECT-288
using cellulase and β-glucosidase in SSF-fed-batch fermentation.
Wang et al. (2011a) reported highly ef ﬁcient D-lactic acid production
from peanut meal hydrolysate and glucose in SSF-fed-batchfermentation, which resulted in 207 g/L and 226 g/L
D-lactic acid
by single pulse and multi-pulse feeding methods, respectively ( Table 7 ).
Similarly, Ou et al. (2011) have reported production of 80 g/L lactic acid
from cellulose by B. coagulans 36D1 using multi-pulse feeding of cellulose
in SSF-fed-batch fermentation. SSF-f ed-batch fermentation using mixed
strains of Aspergillus niger SL-09 and Lactobacillus sp. G-02 as the pro-
ducers of hydrolytic enzymes (inulinase and invertase) and lactic acid,
respectively, produced 120.5 g/L L-lactic acid from Jerusalem artichoke
tubers with the L-lactic acid yield of 0.945 g/g-total sugars for 36 h of cul-
tivation ( Ge et al., 2009).
Although fed-batch process is an industrially preferred fermenta-
tion as it allows higher lactic acid concentration –up to 226 g/L as
reported by Wang et al. (2011a) , the productivity is relatively low
(≤4.7 g/L/h; Ge et al., 2010 )[Table 7 ]. Methods that increase the
lactic acid concentration along with productivity are required.
4.3. Repeated fermentation
Repeated fermentation with batch or fed-batch fermentation in-
volves repeated cycles by inoculating a part or all of the cells from a pre-
vious run into the next run ( Zhao et al., 2010a ). Different methods
applied for cell recycling by bacteria (centrifugation, use of hollowﬁber module, or use part of the culture) and fungi ( ﬁltration or mycelial
pellet precipitation) in repeated fermentation process are summarizedinTable 8 . In comparison with normal batch or fed-batch fermentation
(Table 5 ), repeated fermentation has several advantages, including in-
crease the yield, saving time and labor processes required for cleaning
and sterilizing the fermentor, omission of seed preparation time, high
cell concentration and high lactic acid productivity, and short fermenta-
tion time due to the high initial inoculation volume ( Naritomi et al.,
2002 ). A comparison of lactic acid fermentation results obtained from
batch and fed-batch or repeated batch fermentations by some studies
is summarized in Table 9 .
It should be again emphasized that minimizing the fermentation time
that would increase the productivity is of pivotal importance for lac-
tic acid production by a microbial fermentation process. Zhao et al.
(2010b) reported a maximum
L-lactic acid production of 107 g/L with
an optical purity of 99.8% using a thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain 2-6 in
open (nonsterilized) repeated batch fermentation ( Table 8). Kim et al.
(2006) reported an improvement in lactic acid productivity (6.34 g/L/h)
in repeated batch fermentation from cheese whey by Lactobacillus sp.
RKY2, which was 6.2 times higher than that obtained from batch fermen-
tation. Similarly, Wee et al. (2006) reported an enhanced lactic acid pro-
d u c t i v i t yo f4 . 0g / L / hf r o mw o o dh y d r o l y s a t ea n dc o r ns t e e pl i q u o ri nt h erepeated batch fermentation of Enteroccocus faecalis RKY1, which was
2.7-fold higher than that obtained from traditional batch fermentation.We have recently obtained the highest lactic acid productivity at
12.3 g/L/h in open repeated fermentation by E. mundtii QU 25 that
was 5.5-fold higher than obtained by batch fermentation [ Table 9 ]
(Abdel-Rahman et al., 2013 ). Repeated fed-batch fermentation has
also been reported using Lb. casei subsp. rhamnosus (ATCC 11443),887 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902Table 7

(Velázquez et al., 2001 ). Multiple-stage repeated fermentation was
reported to improve productivity in repeated fermentations by avoidingthe inhibitory effects of high product concentrations on lactic acid pro-
ducing strains ( Ito et al., 1991; Shimizu, 1996; Zhao et al., 2010a ).
Two-stage repeated batch fermentation exhibited a higher performancefor
D-lactic acid production than the 1-reactor system ( Table 8 )b y
Sporolactobacillu s sp. CASD by increasing the cell concentration at an
early stage of fermentation ( Zhao et al., 2010a ).
Repeated fermentation for L-lactic acid production using lactic
acid-producing R. oryzae has been also reported ( Bai et al., 2003a;
Du et al., 1998; Jiang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Yin et al., 1998; Yuet al., 2007 ).Yin et al. (1998) used small mycelia pellets of R. oryzae
NRRL395 for 9 cycles over 14 days and achieved lactic acid productiv-ity up to 2.02 g/L/h from corn starch in an air-lift bioreactor, which
was 1.9-fold higher than that obtained from batch fermentation. Du
et al. (1998) used 2 different physical forms ( ﬁlamentous and pellet)
to produce
L-lactic acid by R. oryzae ATCC 52311 in repeated batch fer-
mentation, and the productivities reached up to 5.06 and 4.39 g/L/h,
respectively. Bai et al. (2003a) achieved lactic acid productivity up
to 3.51 g/L/h in repeated batch fermentation using R. oryzae R1021
from glucose. Yu et al. (2007) reported on repeated batch fermenta-
tion for 6 cycles using the ﬂoc-form of R. oryzae with a maximum lac-
tic acid productivity and yield of 4.03 g/L/h and 0.90 g/g, respectively.
Liu et al. (2008) developed a process for coproduction of lactic acid
and chitin using pelletized R. oryzae NRRL 395 with a lactic acid con-
centration and productivity of 66 g/L and 2.4 g/L/h, respectively.
Recently, Wu et al. (2011) performed repeated batch fermentation
using R. oryzae AS 3.819 pellets for L-lactic acid production for 25 cy-
cles in a 7-l magnetically stirred fermentor. During this fermentation
process, lactic acid concentration and productivity were 103.7 g/L and
2.16 g/L/h for the ﬁrst cycle, respectively; however, in the next 19
repeated cycles, the ﬁnal lactic acid production reached 81 –95 g/L,
and the productivity reached 3.40 –3.85 g/L/h ( Table 9 ). Further studies
on fungal growth characteristics and metabolic processes duringrepeated fermentation are still required; speci ﬁcally concerning
morphology of fungal strain that in ﬂuences the rate of microorgan-
ism growth and product formation ( Wu et al., 2011 ).
4.4. Conventional continuous fermentation
Production of lactic acid is strictly associated with cell growth,
which allows the cells to obtain the necessary energy for growth
from lactic acid producing pathways. Continuous lactic acidfermentation is attractive in terms of avoiding the end-product inhi-bition that occurs in batch/fed-batch fermentation by diluting the
product in the fermentation broth with fresh medium ( Table 5 )
(Amrane and Prigent, 1996; Wee and Ryu, 2009 ). Chemostat fermen-
tation is a typical continuous fermentation system in which feeding of
fresh medium to the fermentor and withdrawing fermentation broth
are performed at the same rate to provide constant control of the con-
centration of a component in the fermentation broth. In chemostat
fermentation, the concentrations of cells, products, and substrates in
the fermentation broth can be stably maintained at constant levels dur-
ing certain periods. The speci ﬁc growth rate can be adjusted by the di-
lution rate because the speci ﬁc growth rate would equal the dilution
rate under steady state conditions in chemostat fermentation ( Bustos
et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the dilution rate is an important parameter
that allows productivity to be maximized and should be further investi-
gated. In addition, continuous fermentation is shut down with less fre-
quency than batch fermentation (where the reactor must be emptied,
cleaned, sterilized, and re ﬁlled), and there is less decrease in productiv-
ity during lag phases ( Gassem et al., 1997; Ohara et al., 1992 ). However,
the ef ﬂux of unutilized carbon sources and cells from the fermentor and
the decrease in lactic acid concentration with an increase in the dilution
rate are problematic points during lactic acid production with continuous
fermentation ( Zhang et al., 2011 ). These problems can be solved by using
HCD fermentations, as described in Section 5 .
In conventional continuous fermentation without HCD, we have
reported an improved lactic acid productivity of 1.56 g/L/h fromsago starch with the amylolytic LAB strain Enteroccocus faecium
No. 78 ( Shibata et al., 2007 ) and of 4.53 g/L/h from cassava starch
byLb. plantarum SW14 ( Bomrungnok et al., 2012). Bustos et al.
(2007) reported a lactic acid productivity of 3.1 g/L/h from trimming
vine shoots hydrolysate at a dilution rate of 0.2 h
−1byLb. pentosus
CECT-4023 T. We have recently reported D-lactic acid productivities
of 2.07 –3.55 g/L/h in conventional continuous culture, which was
higher than that obtained in the batch culture (1.67 g/L/h) from glu-cose by Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis QU 41 ( Tashiro et al., 2011).
5. Improved lactic acid fermentation with high cell density
HCD is widely used for several fermentative production processes;
however, it has not been clearly de ﬁned. Approximately 10-fold higher
cell concentrations than those generally used for batch fermentationwould be considered as HCDs ( Chang et al., 2011 ). Fermentative pro-
duction systems using HCD are desirable for cost-effective large-scaleproduction, mainly because of their high productivities and lack ofTable 10

fermentors with HCD can be more compact in size and allow stable
long-term fermentation; however, these systems are dif ﬁcult to design
and operate ( Ozturk, 1994 ).
Several methods are used to achieve HCD, including fed-batch fer-
mentation, cell immobilization, and cell recycling. John and Nampoothiri
(2011) reported a novel method for achieving HCD in Lactobacilli
by coculturing Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei with the fast-growing
Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii and then embedding the coculture on
to polyurethane foam cubes as a bio ﬁlm. Among these methods, fed-
batch fermentation is the most commonly used in commercial practice;however, cell immobilization and cell recycling methods are more suit-
able for continuous fermentation and permit operation at higher dilution
rates than conventional continuous fermentation ( Chang et al., 1994).
Various supports and immobilization techniques have been proposedand tested for application in lactic acid production, as described in next
section. Cell retention can be achieved by sedimentation, centrifugation,
or collection via membranes. The membrane cell recycling technique is
the most widely used as it allows complete recycling of cells ( Chang
et al., 1994 ).Table 10 shows the advantages and disadvantages of cell
recycling methods. In this section, we will focus on cell immobilization
and membrane-based cell recycling techniques for lactic acid production
with HCD.
5.1. Cell immobilization
From an industrial standpoint, cell immobilization methods have be-
come one of the most useful methods for increasing cell concentrations
in fermentors, which should result in higher lactic acid productivity.
In addition, cell immobilization improves cell and operational stability,
reduces the need for nitrogen sources, enables re-utilization operations,
reduces downstream processing by coupling fermentation and separa-
tion processes, and reduces risk of contamination because of a high con-
centration of used cells ( Gao et al., 2004; Øyaas et al., 1996; Panesar
et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2004 ). Furthermore, continuous fermentation
can be operated at high dilution rates without cell washout using
immobilized cells. However, mass-transfer limitations are considered
to be a signi ﬁcant drawback for fermentation with immobilized
cells Kosseva et al. (2009) .Table 11 shows the performance of free/
immobilized cells and operational processes in lactic acid fermenta-
tion. As shown in Table 11, fermentation with immobilized cells
resulted in enhanced lactic acid production with higher productiv-ities than those obtained using free cells.
In general, there are 4 categories of immobilization techniques
(Fig. 2 ,Table 11 ), namely, attachment (adsorption), entrapment, con-
tainment, and self-aggregation ( Kourkoutas et al., 2004; Pilkington et
al., 1998 ). Adsorption (or attachment) on solid carrier surfaces is the
most common because it is simple to carry out and has little in ﬂuenceon the conformation of the cells that are held to the surface of the car-
riers by physical (van der Waals forces) or electrostatic forces or by co-
valent binding between the cell membrane and the carrier ( Goncalves
et al., 1992 ). However, the relative weakness of the adsorptive binding
forces is the major limitation of this technique. The forces of covalent
binding using aggressive chemicals are stronger than physical forces;
however, aggressive chemicals are harmful to the cells and are not pre-ferred for cell immobilization ( Panesar et al., 2007 ). A variety of support
materials have been investigated for adsorption, including activatedcarbon Andrews and Fonta (1989) ,
 aluminum beads ( Tango and
Ghaly, 2002 ), glass and ceramics ( Guoqiang et al., 1992; Zhang et al.,
2011 ), wood chips ( Krischke et al., 1991 ), plastic composite supports
(Velázquez et al., 2001 ), porous bricks and cotton ﬁbers ( Goncalves et
al., 1992; Tay and Yang, 2002 ), and foam ( Dong et al., 1996 ). Loofa
sponges ( Lufa cylindrica ) have been proposed to be the most promising
matrix for an alternative carrier because it is renewable and biodegrad-
able, easy to use, less expensive, and available naturally in abundance
(Ganguly et al., 2007; Ogbonna et al., 1994, 1996; Roble et al., 2003;
Slokoska and Angelova, 1998 ).
Entrapment techniques are also popular for the immobilization of
cells because of the simplicity of using spherical particles containingcells, which can be obtained by dripping a polymer-cell suspension into
a solution containing precipitate-forming counter ions or through ther-
mal polymerization. Materials commonly used for entrapment are poly-
saccharide gels, like calcium alginate, agar, agarose, kappa-carrageenan,
chitosan, and polygalacturonic, or other polymeric matrixes, like gelatin,
collagen, and polyvinyl alcohol ( Elezi et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Park
and Chang, 2000 ). Entrapment using calcium alginate gel beads has
been used extensively for lactic acid production by immobilized cells
(Champagne et al., 1992; Hamamci and Ryu, 1994; Hang et al., 1989;
Wang et al., 1995; Xuemei et al., 1999 ). Slow leakage of cells during con-
tinuous long-term operation can also occur, which would comprise
immobilized and free cells in the fermentor. To avoid this problem,double-layer beads have been developed ( Tanaka et al., 1989 ), and fur-
ther improvements can be made by using suitable cross-linking proce-dures. In addition, the insuf ﬁcient oxygen supply due to the diffusional
resistance of the gel matrixes may decrease fermentation ef ﬁciency, par-
ticularly aerobic fermentation ( Sun et al., 1998 ). Moreover, preparation
of large amounts of gel beads for industrial production may be uneco-nomical and cumbersome ( Ogbonna et al., 1989).
Mechanical containments behind a barrier can be attained by use of
microporous membrane ﬁlters, entrapment of cells in a microcapsule,
or cell immobilization onto an interaction surface of 2 immiscible
liquids ( Chang et al., 2011 ). Mechanical containment is advantageous
when cell-free products and minimum transfer of compounds are re-quired ( Park and Chang, 2000 ). However, mass transfer limitations
and possible membrane biofouling caused by cell growth are the maindisadvantages of this technique ( Kourkoutas et al., 2004 ).

Fig. 2. Categories of immobilization techniques (attachment, entrapment, containment and self-aggregation).893 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902Some microbial cells can aggregate to form larger units that adhere
in clumps and sediment rapidly ( Jin and Speers, 1998 ). Aggregation
can be considered a natural immobilization technique that is mainly ob-
served in molds and fungi. Arti ﬁcial aggregating agents or cross-linkers
can be used to enhance aggregation of cells that cannot aggregate natu-rally ( Kourkoutas et al., 2004 ).
Fungal cell immobilization has been used to control fungal morphol-
ogy and has been shown to achieve high lactic acid productivity by HCD(Ganguly et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007 ). Immobilized Rhizopus cells
have been applied in many bioreactors used in submerged ﬁlamentous
fungal fermentations, including air-lift bioreactors, drum contactors, re-
ciprocating jet bioreactors, tower fermentors, and hollow ﬁber bioreac-
tors ( Lin et al., 1998; Park et al., 1998; Sun et al., 1998, 1999; Tamada
et al., 1992; Tay and Yang, 2002; Y. Liu et al., 2006 ). However, in most
immobilization studies, lactic acid yields were only 0.65 –0.78 g/g, with
lactic acid concentrations of 40 –73 g/L ( Dong et al., 1996; Hamamci
and Ryu, 1994; Hang et al., 1989; Lin et al., 1998; Tamada et al., 1992;Xuemei et al., 1999 ). Although there are reports where lactic acid yields
reached more than 85% ( Efremenko et al., 2006; Kosakai et al., 1997; Tay
and Yang, 2002 ), the complex operational processes of fungal immobili-
zation, attrition of support, and possibility of bioreactor damage at highagitation speed limit their use ( Chotisubha-anandha et al., 2011 ).
Generally, lactic acid production by cell immobilization has been
reported in conventional batch fermentation ( Chotisubha-anandha et
al., 2011; John and Nampoothiri, 2011; Rangaswamy and Ramakrishna,2008; Rosenberg et al., 2005; Sirisa nsaneeyakul et al., 2007; Yamane
and Tanaka, 2013 ) ,f e d - b a t c hf e r m e n t a t i o n( Yamane and Tanaka,
2013 ), SSF-fed-batch fermentation ( Shen and Xia, 2006 ), repeated fer-
mentation ( Ganguly et al., 2007; Rosenberg et al., 2005; Velázquez
et al., 2001; Yen and Lee, 2010; Z. Wang et al., 2010; Zhang et al.,
2011 ), and continuous fermentation ( John et al., 2007a; Rangaswamy
and Ramakrishna, 2008; Sirisansaneeyakul et al., 2007; Tango andGhaly, 2002 ) using different bioreactors, such as packed-bed reactors,
continuous stirred-tank reactors, ﬁbrous-bed reactors, and ﬂuidized-bed
reactors. These ﬁndings are described in detail below.
5.1.1. Packed-bed reactors (PBRs)
A PBR is a simple operational system with high mass-transfer rates
in which the microorganism can be packed into a column in the form
of spheres, chips, disks, sheets, beads, or pellets. This system is especial-
ly appropriate to strains that do not require oxygen for lactic acid
production ( Sirisansaneeyakul et al., 2007 ). However, the periodic ﬂuc-
tuation in the viable cell population due to nutrient depletion along thereactor length is one of the limitations of this system ( Kosseva et al.,
2009 ). Although operation of the fermentor coupled with a packed
bed in continuous fermentation has the potential to achieve simulta-
neous product removal and high productivities, low sugar utilization
or high residual sugar concentrations are the main disadvantages of
this system. In addition, large pH gradients are generated, and therefore,
a large fraction of the immobilized cells do not experience optimal pH
for lactic acid production ( Senthuran et al., 1999 ).
PBRs with immobilized cells have been reported for lactic acid
p
roduction in batch fermentation, repeated batch fermentation
(Senthuran et al., 1997, 1999; Sirisansaneeyakul et al., 2007 ), and
continuous fermentation ( Roukas and Kotzekidou, 1996; Roy et al.,
1987; Sirisansaneeyakul et al., 2007; Tango and Ghaly, 2002 ).
Tango and Ghaly (2002) achieved a high lactic acid concentration
of 75.6 g/L with a yield of 0.96 g/g and a productivity of 3.90 g/L/hfrom whey using Lb. helveticus cells immobilized on alumina beads
in PBR after a hydraulic retention time of 18 h. A PBR using encapsu-lated Lc. lactis IO-1 in a membrane capsule and entrapment in a gel
matrix achieved an even higher lactic acid productivity of 4.5 g/L/hin continuous fermentation at a dilution rate of 0.5 h
−1, compared
to 2.16 g/L/h in batch fermentation and 2.16 –2.47 g/L/h in re-
peated batch fermentation from glucose ( Table 11 )(Sirisansaneeyakul
et al., 2007).5.1.2. Continuous ﬂow stirred tank reactors (CSTR)
CSTRs have been widely used in commercial fermentation pro-
cesses due to its industrial capacity and reliability. In an ideal CSTR,the fermentation broth in the bioreactor is perfectly mixed. CSTR for
lactic acid production by immobilized cells has been reported with
co-immobilized Lb. casei SU No. 22 and Lb. lactis WS 1042 cells
entrapped in Ca-alignate with a lactic acid productivity of 0.72 –
0.86 g/L/h in repeated fermentation ( Roukas and Kotzekidou, 1991 )
and immobilized Lb. casei subsp. casei (DSM 20244) cells onto porous
sintered glass beads with a lactic acid productivity of 5.5 g/L/h at a di-lution rate of 0.22 h
−1(Krischke et al., 1991 ). A maximum lactic acid
productivity of 28.5 g/L/h at a dilution rate of 1.21 h−1was obtained
in continuous fermentation from whey permeate by immobilized
Lb. helveticus L89 cells entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum
gel beads in CSTR ( Norton et al., 1994 ). Immobilization of ﬁlamentous
fungi in a CSTR is often limited by insuf ﬁcient mixing and low mass
transfer due to formation of mycelial clumps that cause operationalproblems and high shear rates and have relatively high power re-
quirements ( Chotisubha-anandha et al., 2011; Z.Y. Zhang et al., 2008 ).
The use of CSTR allows ef ﬁcient control of pH, but often leads to
attrition of the support. On the other hand, large pH gradients are gen-
erated in PBR that do not match the optimal pH for a large fraction of the
immobilized cells ( Senthuran et al., 1999 ). Therefore, a dual reactor sys-
tem by connecting CSTR and PBR using immobilized cells has been alsoreported ( Rangaswamy and Ramakrishna, 2008; Sirisansaneeyakul
et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011 ). With this system, a signi ﬁcant enhance-
ment of lactic acid productivities, yields, and ﬁnal concentrations has
been achieved by avoiding attrition of the support by ef ﬁciently control-
ling the pH. Rangaswamy and Ramakrishna (2008) operated a dual re-
actor in continuous fermentation for more than 1000 h and achievedconstant lactic acid productivity of 5 g/L/h from sucrose by immobilized
Lb. delbrueckii NCIM 2365 cells on polyurethane foams in comparison to
productivities of 2.0 –2.5 g/L/h in batch fermentation and 0.65 g/L/h in
continuous fermentation using free cell systems ( Rangaswamy and
Ramakrishna, 2008 ). Similarly, Zhang et al. (2011) operated this dual
system with immobilized Lb. lactis 11 cells on ceramic beads and en-
hanced lactic acid concentrations by 16.6% and productivities by 12.5%compared to those obtained from free cell systems in continuous
fermentation ( Table 11 ).
5.1.3. Fibrous-bed reactor
Fibrous-bed bioreactors have been reported for lactic acid produc-
tion by cell immobilization in ﬁbrous matrices, e.g., cotton cloths, packed
in fermentor vessels ( Shi et al., 2012; Silva and Yang, 1995 ). Fibrous-bed
reactors have been greatly improved in terms of packing designs to
allow for more uniform structures and to minimize diffusion limitations,
greatly improving fermentation ef ﬁciency ( Vijayakumar et al., 2008 ).
Silva and Yang (1995) investigated the kinetics and long-term stability
ofﬁbrous-bed bioreactors for continuous lactic acid production from
unsupplemented acid whey containing 3.7% (w/v) lactose and 0.8%(w/v) lactic acid using immobilized Lb. helveticus ATCC 15009 cells.
Depending on the dilution rate and lactic acid concentration, productiv-ities ranging from 2.6 to 7 g/L/h were achieved, which were10 times
higher than those in batch fermentation with free cells. Shi et al.
(2012) reported a high
L-lactic acid production of 142 g/L from Jerusalem
artichoke hydrolysate by immobilized Lc. lactis ATCC19435 in a ﬁbrous-
bed bioreactor with fed-batch fermentation; this value was 27.92%higher than that in fed-batch fermentation using free cells (103 g/L)
as shown in Table 11 . They also achieved high
L-lactic acid yields ranging
from 0.84 to 1.01 g/g and productivities ranging from 0.71 to 2.85 g/L/hwith long-term persistence (approximately 780 h) by repeated fermen-
tation with a ﬁbrous-bed reactor [ Table 11 ](Shi et al., 2012 ). The
ﬁbrous-bed reactor was also reported as an effective system for lactic
acid fermentation by Rhizopus sp., which allowed operational problems
common to conventional fungal fermentation processes to be avoided.Tay and Yang (2002) used a rotating ﬁbrous-bed bioreactor to produce894 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –902Table 12

127 g/L with a yield of 0.90 g/g and a productivity of 1.65 g/L/h was
obtained from cornstarch in fed-batch fermentation ( Tay and Yang,
2002 ).Thongchul and Yang (2006) developed thin mycelial layers to in-
crease oxygen transfer for the improvement of lactic acid production.Chotisubha-anandha et al. (2011) revealed that mass transport was
the rate-limiting factor in a static ﬁbrous-bed reactor using R. oryzae .
Immobilized R. oryzae NRRL 395 on a cotton matrix in a ﬁbrous-bed re-
actor achieved a maximum lactic acid concentration of 37.8 g/L from70 g/L glucose with a yield of 0.62 g/g and a productivity of 2.09 g/L/h
(Chotisubha-anandha et al., 2011 ).
5.1.4. Fluidized-bed reactors (FBRs)
FBRs are widely employed with cell immobilization systems. In
these reactors, ﬂuidization is achieved by the combined upward and
downward movements of particles; therefore, FBRs provide a degreeof mixing that is between the 2 extremes of the PBR and the CSTR. In
addition, higher mass transfer and heat transfer rates are expected
than those in PBRs. The application of FBRs for lactic acid production
has rarely been studied due to their dif ﬁculty in scale-up, short-term
operation and the requirement for regeneration of a biocatalyst
(Davison and Scott, 1992; Kaufman et al., 1995; Krischke et al.,
1991; Lin et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2008 ).Krischke et al. (1991)
reported higher lactic acid productivities of 10 g/L/h at a dilution
rate of 0.4 h
−1and of 13.5 g/L/h at a dilution rate 1.0 h−1from
whey permeate by Lb. casei subsp. casei DSM 20244 (immobilized
by adsorption on sintered glass beads) in FBR than those achieved
in CSTR (5.5 g/L/h at a dilution rate of 0.22 h−1). Two solid particles
(the immobilized biocatalyst and the adsorbent particle) were usedto form the biparticle ﬂuidized-bed bioreactor that enhanced lactic
acid production. Davison and Scott (1992) achieved enhanced lactic
acid production in biparticle FBR with gel beads of Lb. delbreuckii
ATCC 9649 cells entrapped in k-carrageenan and activated carbon as
an adsorbent (absorb lactic acid) for simultaneous production and
recovery of lactic acid in batch fermentation. Similarly, Davison and
Thompson (1992) immobilized Lb. delbreuckii in alginate beads and
ﬂuidized the beads by upward- ﬂowing liquid media in a tubular
reactor. After that, the adsorbent, polyvinyl pyridine resin Reillex425 was added to the top of the reactor, fell through the biocatalyst
bed, and was found to adsorb lactic acid, moderate broth pH, and
increase lactic acid production nearly 4-fold over a control FBR with-
out the addition of resin. Kaufman et al. (1995) used biparticle FBR
with immobilized Lb. delbreuckii NRRL B445 cells in gelatin beads
and for in situ removal of the inhibitory products and achieved a
12-fold increase in productivity (4.7 g/L/h) using absorbent addition
(IRA-35 resin), compared to that achieved without absorbent addi-
tion ( Kaufman et al., 1995 ).Lin et al. (2007) proposed an extractive
fermentation process as a recovery method for
L-lactic production
with immobilized R. oryzae NRRL 395 by using trialkyl phosphine
oxide as an extractant in 3-phase FBRs. By this method, product inhi-bition was alleviated and a high
L-lactic acid productivity of 11 g/L/h
was achieved. Patel et al. (2008) constructed a dual-particle liquid –
solid circulating ﬂuidized bed (DP-LSCFB) bioreactor for the simulta-
neous production and recovery of lactic acid using immobilized
Lb. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 and ion-exchange resins with a produc-
tion of 240 g lactic acid.
5.2. Membrane cell recycling
Membrane cell recycling systems are another method for achiev-
ing HCD ( Table 10 ), where ultra ﬁltration membrane, micro ﬁltration,
or cross- ﬂow membrane in a semi-closed loop is used for separating
the permeate from the cells and recycling the cells back to the biore-
actor. This system has advantages of achieving broth homogeneity,complete cell recycling, and in situ production and separation of the
fermentation product. It can also enhance not only the conversion rate
of the substrate in the medium but also the lactic acid productivity
due to the much higher cell concentration achieved compared with
conventional fermentation processes without HCD. Table 12 summa-
rizes several studies used membrane cell recycling systems coupledwith different fermentation modes. With this method, continuous fer-mentation can be operated at a higher dilution rate —up to 2.8 h
−1
without cell washout achieving high lactic acid productivity up to160 g/L/h [ Table 12 ](Ohleyer et al., 1985 ).
Polymeric membranes used in those fermentation methods suffer
from intolerance to high temperatures required for sterilization,
fouling problems, and the requirement for cleaning procedures that
weaken the membrane, leading to increased replacement costs.
These problems hindered its mass application in industry ( Giorno
et al., 2002; Wee and Ryu, 2009 ). To overcome fouling problems,
membrane cell recycling bioreactors have been designed in differ-
ent ways. Modifying the mechanical design of the bioreactor also
achieved potential improvements in performance. Xu et al. (2006)
employed an electromagnetic ﬂow meter and a pneumatic dia-
phragm pump to a membrane cell recycling bioreactor to alleviate
membrane fouling. They achieved continuous lactic acid fermenta-
tion with a productivity of 31.5 g/L/h and a long operational stability
of 155.5 h, compared to those achieved using a peristaltic pump or
diaphragm pump without an electromagnetic ﬂow meter (56 and
85 h, respectively). Moreover, this system could repeat periodicallywith intermittent online cleaning and sterilization of the mem-
brane ﬁltration system. Ramchandran et al. (2012) applied a
media-backwash method using fresh medium as a backwash medi-um to maintain the performance of the submerged hollow ﬁber
membrane module. This process resulted in improved yield and amore than 2-fold increase in lactic acid production.
Ceramic membranes have proven to offer advantages of high
thermal stability, easier cleaning, high resistance to acid and alkaline
conditions, and high mechanical and abrasive resistance compared
with polymeric membranes. As shown in Table 12,t h eo p e r a -
tional stability using ceramic membrane is higher than polymericmembranes —up to 240 h in continuous couture ( Ohashi et al., 1999 ).
Jung and Lovitt (2010) used an external ceramic micro ﬁltration mem-
brane and achieved improvements in cell concentrations (~14-fold)with 10 –33 times higher biomass production rates than those in
the CSTR by using 4 industrially important LAB ( Lactobacillus buchneri ,
Lb. brevis ,Oenococcus oeni ,a n d Biﬁdobacterium longum ). Recently,
Lu et al. (2012) reported enhanced pilot-scale (3000-L fermentor) pro-
duction of
L-lactic acid at 157.2 g/L with a productivity of 8.77 g/L/h
using an external ceramic micro ﬁltration membrane ( Table 12 ).
Although increased lactic acid productivities were obtained with
continuous fermentation by HCD with cell recycling, the lactic acidconcentration was relatively low (less than 60 g/L in most studies)
compared to those achieved during other fermentation processes
(up to 231 g/L in fed-batch fermentation by Yamane and Tanaka,
2013 ,Table 11), which would greatly increase the energy cost for
water removal in the downstream process ( Kwon et al., 2001).
With an increase in annual lactic acid production capacity, thisbioprocess may be primarily in ﬂuenced by production capacity and
product concentrations and to a lesser extent by productivity(Timmer and Kromkamp, 1994 ).Kulozik et al. (1992) investigated
the performance of a 7-stage cascade reactor with membrane cellrecycling, which resulted in a lactic acid concentration of 72 g/L at
a productivity of 28 g/L/h. Kwon et al. (2001) produced 92 g/L of
D-lactic acid with a productivity of 57 g/L/h in a 2-stage bioreactor
with membrane cell recycling by Lb. rhamosus ATCC 10863. A prog-
ress in multi-stage HCD continuous systems should be addressedand realized for lactic acid production that would be produced in a
titer equivalent to the fed-batch, but with much higher productivity
than the fed-batch.896 M.A. Abdel-Rahman et al. / Biotechnology Advances 31 (2013) 877 –9026. Advances in lactic acid recovery processes
One of the major considerations in the commercial production of
lactic acid is purifying the recovered product to meet quality stan-
dards requirements for speci ﬁc applications. Conventional fermen-
tation process produces lactate salt, as a result of pH neutralization,that must be precipitated and reacidi ﬁed by a mineral acid such as
sulfuric acid. These steps are considered as major economic hurdles
for lactic acid production because it consumes expensive chemical
that accounts for 50% of the production cost and that generates gyp-
sum waste materials ( Chaudhuri and Pyle, 1992; Eyal and Bressler,
1993). Several recovery techniques have been reported on the sepa-ration of lactic acid produced in the fermentation broth without pre-
cipitation such as diffusion dialysis ( Narebskam and Staniszewski,
1997), solvent extraction ( Hano et al., 1993 ), direct distillation
(Cockrem and Johnson, 1993), liquid surfactant membrane ex-
traction ( Sirman et al., 1991), adsorption ( Kaufman et al., 1994 ),
chromatographic methods ( Hauer and Marr, 1994 ), ultra ﬁltration
(Hauer and Marr, 1994 ), reverse osmosis ( Hauer and Marr, 1994;
Timmer et al., 1994 ), drying ( Hauer and Marr, 1994 ), conventional
electrodialysis ( Boyaval et al., 1987; Heriban et al., 1993; Hongo
et al., 1986; Kim and Moon, 2001; Thang et al., 2005 )a n db i p o l a r
membrane electrodialysis ( Bailly, 2002). Among those, the electro-
dialysis technique has been found to be potentially effective in the
recovery of lactic acid from fermentation broth due to its rapid treat-
ment, effective removal of non-ionic molecules, concentration of lactic
acid, and environmentally sustainable process ( Boniardi et al., 1997 ).
Additionally, in-situ recovery technique has the potential to not onlyrecover lactic acid but also relieve product inhibition. Conventional
electrodialysis generally uses ion-exchange membranes under the in-
ﬂuence of direct current for separating and concentrating ions in solu-
tion. In-situ conventional electrodialysis with the cathode located inthe compartment of the fermentor has been shown to damage the bac-
terial cells by direct contact with the electrodes. To prevent the cells
from contacting with the electrodes, an ultra ﬁltration step has been
introduced before the electrodialysis process ( Nomura et al., 1991 ).
Furthermore, pH control is an important factor that should limit the
technical and commercial viability in electrodialysis processes ( Hongo
et al., 1986; Vonktaveesuk et al., 1994 ). In order to maintain a pH at
the suitable value, an additional pH control system with the additionof alkaline solution was incorporated into the electrodialysis process
(Vonktaveesuk et al., 1994 ). Several recent studies have also applied
electrodialysis to recover lactic acid from fermentation broth ( Gao
et al., 2005; Hábová et al., 2004; Wee et al., 2005; Yi et al., 2008 ).
To date, various attempts have been made to develop the technol-
ogy of electrodialysis by using bipolar membrane. Bipolar membrane
electrodialysis is equipped with the integration of conventional
electrodialysis and water splitting within the bipolar membrane
(Franken, 2000; Timbuntam et al., 2008 ). This process is advanta-
geous in the capability of separation, puri ﬁcation and concentration
of salts, and in the conversion of these salts into acid and base with-
out generating waste ef ﬂuents containing high concentrations of
salts. In addition, the generated base can be recycled for the neutral-ization of the fermentation process ( Franken, 2000 ).Li
 et al. (2004)
developed a bioreactor with bipolar membrane electrodialysis forboth lactic acid removal and pH control in lactic acid fermentation
byLb. rhamnosus NCIMB 6375, which increased the lactic acid yield
to 0.61 g/g glucose, compared to that achieved without electrodialy-sis (0.46 g/g glucose). Min-tian et al. (2005) achieved production of
2637 g lactic acid from 4000 g glucose at a productivity of 8.18 g/L/hand a yield of 0.69 g/g in continuous fermentation integrated with
bipolar membrane electrodialysis using Lb. rhamnosus IFO 3863.
However, there is still a compatibility issue between electrodialysisand fermentation process that should be carefully arranged to
achieve a synchronous operation of the fermentation and electrodi-
alysis process.7. Concluding remarks
In this review, the latest results and ideas relating to the key aspects
of lactic acid production research were summarized and compared.
Microbial lactic acid producers and fermentative substrates, including
pure and edible sugars and their alternatives (i.e., lignocellulosic and
starchy biomasses, dairy byproducts, agro-industrial and food wastes,glycerol and algal biomass), which have dual advantages in both over-
coming current environmental problems and lowering lactic acid pro-
duction costs were described. In addition, various fermentation
processes and methods that enhance lactic acid concentrations, yields,
and productivities were pointed out. New developments in lactic acid
fermentation techniques that alleviate dif ﬁculties associated with pro-
duction were also discussed; however, certain issues like end-productinhibition still have to be addressed.
End-product inhibition is still the major problem associated with
efﬁcient lactic acid fermentation, even with HCD. Controlling the pH
during fermentation only partly mitigates this inhibition ( Savoie et al.,
2007 ). Removing lactic acid during fermentation has resulted in a
50-fold enhancement in cell concentrations with dialysis membranes;however, this process requires relatively large membrane areas, which
must be accommodated outside of the fermentation vessel ( Osborne
et al., 1975 ). Although electrodialysis is a simple method that can re-
move acids selectively during fermentation, it has several limitations,
including decreases in both volumetric and speci ﬁcl a c t i ca c i dp r o d u c -
tivity ( Vaida et al., 1991 ). Some of these challenges have been addressed
by the reverse electro-enhanced dialysis process, which has been
shown to achieve higher lactic acid productivity and cell biomass as
well as manage fouling by periodic charge reversal ( Prado-Rubio et al.,
2011; Rype et al., 2009 ). Further developments in such methods are
required to ensure effective bioprocesses for better lactic acid fermenta-
tion characteristics, including greater purities, yields, and concentra-
tions, in addition to their eco-friendly production resulting from the
direct production of lactic acid instead of the lactate salts common to
conventional processes.
