Osmotolerance is one of the critical factors for successful survival and colonization of
microbes in saline environments. Nonetheless, informatio n about these osmotolerance
mechanisms is still inadequate. Exploration of the saline s oil microbiome for its
community structure and novel genetic elements is likely to provide information
on the mechanisms involved in osmoadaptation. The present s tudy explores
the saline soil microbiome for its native structure and nove l genetic elements

INTRODUCTION
Soil is a rich and dynamic ecosystem, containing a vast numbe r of microorganisms ( van Veen
etal.,1997 ).Geologicalactivitieslikeweatheringofrocks,windsand pooragriculturalpracticeare
continuouslyincreasingsaltcontentsofthesoils( Jiangetal.,2007;Canforaetal.,2014 ).Enhanced
soilsalinitymodulatesthemicrobialcommunitystructurea nditsphysiologicalactivity( Jiangetal.,
2007; Canfora et al., 2014; Shrivastava and Kumar, 2015 ). The majority of microbes surviving
in salt stress conditions demonstrate osmotolerance for va rying duration, which may extend
even to their entire lifespan ( Roberts, 2005 ). The salt stress tolerance mechanisms are complex
phenomena where pathways are coordinately linked ( Culligan et al., 2012 ). These metabolic
strengthstomitigateosmoticstress,seemtobegeneticall yevolvedthroughhorizontalgenetransfer
(Koonin and Wolf, 2012; Yan et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2017 ). Description of these osmotolerance
mechanisms is crucial for comprehensive understanding of th e biology of saline soil microbes,
and exploiting them for their applications in improving soil qua lity and crop yields ( Xiao and
Roberts, 2010; Zhengbin et al., 2011; Culligan et al., 2012, 20 13, 2014; Fernandes, 2014 ). A varietyAhmed et al. Osmotolerance Genes from Saline Soil
of culture dependent studies have been carried out to decode
the gene(s) involved in osmotolerance within halophilic or
halotolerant microbes ( Zuleta et al., 2003; Klähn et al., 2009;
Naughton et al., 2009; Meena et al., 2017 ). These studies have
deciphered the role of proteins, Na+/H+pumps, compatible
solutes in salt stress tolerance ( Sakamoto and Murata, 2002;
Roberts,2005 ).However,cultureindependentapproachprovides
a vast opportunity for searching salt tolerant gene (s) ( Singh
J. et al., 2009; Mirete et al., 2015; Kumar J. et al., 2016;
Chauhan et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2017 ). Only a few studies
have used metagenomic approach to decode the microbial salt
stress tolerance mechanisms from various environments lik e
pond water ( Kapardar et al., 2010a,b ), brines and moderate-
salinityrhizosphere( Mireteetal.,2015 ),humangutmicrobiome
(Culligan et al., 2012, 2013, 2014 ). Incidentally, the number of
genes/pathways identiﬁed for salt stress tolerance are far be low
than the number of microbes which have been identiﬁed to
reside within these environments ( Humbert et al., 2009; Mirete
et al., 2015 ). Hereby, the current study was proposed to identify
the genetic machinery used by microbes as survival strategi es
in salt stress condition using functional metagenomic approa ch.
The current study led to the identiﬁcation of a number of
osmotolerant genes that could be used to develop strategies to
ensuresurvivalofmicrobesundersalineconditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Saline Soil Sample Collection and
Metagenomic DNA Isolation
Saline soil samples were collected in sterile containers aft er
carefully removing the surface layer (up to 10cm) from
Village Malab, District Nuh situated at 28.0107◦N, 77.0564◦E.
Metagenomic DNA was extracted from 5g of the soil sample
(SupplementaryMethods).
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in the study are listed in
Table1. The oligonucleotides used in the study (GeNoRime,
Shrimpex Biotech services Pvt. Ltd. India) are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. Escherichia coli (DH10B) and E. coli
(MKH13) strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.
Further,E.coli(DH10B)and E.coli(MKH13)strainscontaining
pUC19vector were cultured in LB medium supplemented with
ampicillin (100 µg ml−1). All overnight cultures were grown in
LBbrothat37◦Cwithconstantshakingat200rpm.
Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Saline Soil
Metagenome
Saline soil metagenomic DNA was used to amplify the SSU
rRNA gene (Supplementary Methods). The ampliﬁed product
was used for next generation sequencing (NGS) with the aid of
Roche 454 GS FLX +platform ( Morowitz et al., 2011; Gupta
etal.,2017 ).Finally,QuantitativeInsightsIntoMicrobialEcology
(QIIME)1.9.0pipelinewasimplementedforSSUrRNAsequence
data analysis ( Caporaso et al., 2011 ). SSU rRNA gene sequence
data was curated for quality, length and ambiguous bases as a
quality ﬁltering step. Each sample was pre-processed to removesequences with length less than 200 nucleotides and more
than 1,000 nucleotides and sequences with minimum average
quality <25.Readswithambiguitiesandbarcodemismatchwere
discarded. Reads were assigned to operational taxonomic unit s
(OTUs) using a closed reference OTU picking protocol using
QIIME. The uclust was applied to search sequences against a
subset of the Greengenes database, version 13_8 ﬁltered at 9 7%
sequence identity. The OTUs were classiﬁed taxonomically by
using the Greengenes reference database at various taxonom ic
ranks(phylum,class,order,family,genus,andspecies).
Metagenomic Library Screening and
Characterization of Salt Resistant Clones
Plasmid borne saline soil metagenomic library was prepared in
E. coliDH10B using pUC19 vector (Supplementary Methods)
(Chauhanetal.,2009,2017 )andmanuallyscreenedforsaltstress
tolerant clones ( Kapardar et al., 2010a,b ). Salt stress resistant
clones were screened by plating the soil metagenomic library
(∼165,000 clones with an average insert of 1.89Kb) on LB
agar medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1)
and NaCl [5.8% (w/v)]. The 5.8% of NaCl (w/w) is a lethal
concentration for E. coliDH10B cells and will allow the growth
of only osmotolerant clones. RFLP analysis of salt stress tol erant
clones was performed after digesting their recombinant plasm id
DNA with EcoRI &HindIII at 37◦C for 12h. The minimum
inhibitory concentration assay and growth inhibition stud ies
were performed to analyze the salt stress tolerance property
(Kapardar et al., 2010a,b ). Growth inhibition assays of salt
sensitive E. coliMKH13 clones were performed with 3% NaCl
(w/v) & 3.7% KCl (w/v), while 5.8% NaCl (w/v) & 5.5 % of KCl
(w/v)wereusedfor E.coliDH10Bclones.Graphs(createdusing
Origin61) are presented as the average of triplicate experimen ts,
with error bars being representative of the standard error of the
mean.
Genetic and Physiological Characterization
of Salt Tolerance Genes
The plasmid insert from salt resistant recombinant clones
were sequenced using Sanger sequencing chemistry with
primer walking approach at Euroﬁns Genomics India Pvt. Ltd
(Bangalore, India). Sequence assembly was performed with Se q-
Man sequence assembly software Lasergene package, version
5.07 (DNA Star, USA). Putative open reading frame (ORF)
was predicted using an ORF ﬁnder tool at NCBI (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html) and checked for the dat abase
homology with Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool
(BLAST) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Encoded pro tein
sequences were analyzed for the presence of conserved domains
(CDD) ( Marchler-Bauer et al., 2014 ), topology prediction
(HMMTOP) ( Tusnády and Simon, 2001 ), phylogenetic analysis
(MEGA7) ( Kumar S. et al., 2016 ), and various physiological
parameters ( Tsirigos et al., 2015 ). Transposon mutagenesis
ofpSSR1,pSSR4,pSSR6,andpSSR21was carried out with
EZ-Tn5TM<Kan-2>Insertion kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies)
following manufacturer’s instructions. Transposon mutants of
pSSR1,pSSR4,pSSR6,andpSSR21were screened for the salt

Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Saline Soil
Metagenome
Physico-chemical properties of saline soil showed that the
pH of soil was 9.0 ±0.025, while its electrical conductivity
(EC) was 6.5 ±0.023. Elemental analysis of soil showed the
excessive presence of salts, sodium (105 ppm), potassium
(155 ppm), and lithium (188 ppm), conﬁrming its moderate
saline nature. A good quality (A260/280 >1.8), high molecular
weight ( >23Kb) metagenomic DNA was extracted from the
saline soil sample. Saline soil metagenomic DNA was used
to analyze its SSU rRNA gene sequences to decode its native
microbiome structure. Clustering of SSU rRNA gene identiﬁed
a total of 487 OTUs distributed across seven microbial phyla
(Figure1). Out of 487 OTUs, we observed 153 unique OTUs
(Supplementary Table S2). The inferred phylogeny of the
soil microbiome based upon 153 unique OTUs ( Figure1)
was comparable to the taxonomic classiﬁcations against
with greengenes database, with most of the diversity of the
microbiome being attributed to phyla Proteobacteria. The
phylogenywasvisualizedbyiTOL( LetunicandBork,2016 ).The
dominant microbial phyla were Proteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,
Gemmatimonadetes ,Bacteroidetes ,Firmicutes, andAcidobacteria
(Figure1). Among these phyla, the majority of sequences were
aﬃliated to Proteobacteria (43.7%) having a representation
ofAlphaproteobacteria (38.9%), Betaproteobacteria (7%),

was aﬃliated to Acidobacteria (2.5%),Firmicutes (2.1%),
andNitrospirae (0.6%) microbial groups within saline soil
microbiome. The taxonomic classiﬁcation of saline soil
microbiome conﬁrms that a majority of microbial taxa belong s
tophylum Proteobacteria (Figure1)(SupplementaryTableS2).
Screening of Salt Stress Resistant Clones
from Saline Soil Microbiome
A saline soil metagenomic library was constructed with a tot al
representation of 312MB of cloned soil microbiome DNA.
Primary screening of a saline soil metagenomic library at 5. 8%
NaCl (w/v) led to the identiﬁcation of 24 salt stress tolerant
clones. However, RFLP analysis indicated the presence of only
four unique recombinant plasmids, labeled as pSSR1,pSSR4,
pSSR6,andpSSR21. Minimum inhibitory concentration analysisshowedalmosttwofoldhighersaltstresstoleranceofSSR1,S SR4,
SSR6, and SSR21 clones in comparison to the control E. coli
(DH10B) (Supplementary Figure S1). The SSR1, SSR4, SSR6,
and SSR21 also showed a statistically signiﬁcant ( P=0.0009,
P=0.0003,P=0.0014,P=0.004) growth advantage in
the presence of NaCl [4.0% (w/v)] ( Figure2A ) and KCl [5.5%

compared to E. coli(DH10B) strain carrying empty plasmid
vector (pUC19) (Figure2B ), whereas no signiﬁcant growth
diﬀerence was observed between SSR1, SSR4, SSR6, SSR21, and
native host E. coli(DH10B) carrying pUC19 in the presence of

the nucleotide level in existing database sequences. A tota l of
threeORFs were predicted within the cloned insert, encoding
proteins of 207, 507, and 210 amino acids respectively ( Table2).

DISCUSSION
Metagenomics has the potential to advance our knowledge by
studying the genetic components of uncultured microbes ( Singh
A. H. et al., 2009; Mirete et al., 2015; Chauhan et al., 2017;
Yadavetal.,2017 ).Lookingattheperspectivesofmetagenomics,
it was used to explore soil microbiome for its composition
and genetic/physiological mechanisms allowing successful
adaptation of microbes in saline environments. Simultaneous ly,
these genes could be utilized as potential candidate to devel op
ever demanding drought resistant transgenic crops ( Zhengbin
et al., 2011 ) or osmotolerant microbes for food processing
(Fernandes, 2014 ) and waste water treatment applications
(Xiao and Roberts, 2010 ). Metagenomic analysis based on
SSU rRNA gene has identiﬁed dominance of Proteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Bacteroidetes, andGemmatimonadetes in saline
soil microbiome. These results are in parallel with the outco me
of previous studies deﬁning microbial community composition
of saline soil environment ( Zhang et al., 2003; Ma and Gong,
2013; Canfora et al., 2014; Kadam and Chuan, 2016 ). Canfora
et al. has reported a correlation in abundance of a microbial
group with respect to soil salinity. They had indicated a rela tive
abundance of Proteobacteria withBacteroidetes were positively
andAcidobacteria was negatively correlated with salinity
(Canfora et al., 2014 ). Similarly Actinobacteria was also been
reported as another dominant microbial phylum in saline
ecosystems ( Kadam and Chuan, 2016 ). Gemmatimonadetes is
another well-known hypersaline microbial phylum associated
with biogeochemical transformations ( Zhang et al., 2003 ). The
existence of halophilic subcomponents within the identiﬁed
microbial phylum, possibly making them capable to proliferate
in a saline environment. These studies explain the abundance
ofProteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Gemmatimonadetes, and
Bacteroidetes in the studied ecosystem. Evolution of novel
geneticfeaturesisakeytotheirsuccessfulsurvivalinach anging
environment ( Gupta et al., 2017; Kumar Mondal et al., 2017 ).
These saline microorganisms could have evolved salt stress
tolerant genetic machinery to adapt and survive under salt
induced osmotic stresses ( Meena et al., 2017 ). A number of
geneticelementsweredecodedforosmotolerancepropertyfrom
cultured and uncultured microbial representatives ( Kapardar
et al., 2010a,b; Culligan et al., 2012, 2013, 2014; Kim and Yu,
2012; Mirete et al., 2015 ). However, there is a disparity in a
number of reported salt tolerance genes with a number of
microorganisms from an ecosystem ( Humbert et al., 2009;
Mirete et al., 2015 ). This divergence could be allied with a
number of factors like unculturability ( Kim and Yu, 2012 ), lack
of good quality genomic/metagenomic DNA ( Kumar J. et al.,
2016) and issues with foreign gene expression ( Prakash and
Taylor, 2012 ). An additional eﬀort was made in the current
study to decode osmotolerance genes prevalent in these salin e
soil microorganisms using functional metagenomics. It lea ds to
the identiﬁcation of four unique osmotolerant clones harbori ng
DNA insert showing aﬃliation within halophile genomes.
Genetic and physiological analysis has identiﬁed genes enco ding
putative proteins like membrane bound branched chain amino
acid (BCAA) ABC transporter protein (BCAA_ABCTP),
Glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase, cytosolic STKc_PknB an d
DUF protein are responsible for osmotolerance property
within salt stress tolerant clones. Among these, the role of th e
branched chain amino acid (BCAA) ABC transporter protein
and glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase in osmotolerance are
well documented ( Takami et al., 2002; Brosnan and Brosnan,
2006), while the scanty information is available about role
for STKc_PknB and DUF3445 protein in stress maintenance
(Hatziosetal.,2013 ).
ABC branched chain amino acid (BCAA) transporters are
widelydistributedinvariousmarinemicrobeslike Oceanibacillus
iheyensis (Takami et al., 2002 ),Salinispora, Bacillus, and
Roseobacter strains (Penn and Jensen, 2012 ). BCAA_ABCTP
proteins are involved in the transport of branched chain
aliphatic amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine and valine at

high salt concentration. In the presence of 2-oxoglutarate a nd
pyridoxal-5-phosphate, these branched chain amino acids are
further converted to L-glutamate by branched chain amino ac id
transferase ( Hutson, 2001 ). Accumulated glutamate acts as an
osmoprotectant upon hyper-osmotic shock and activates sets of
genes that allow the host to achieve long-term adaptation to
high osmolarity ( Gralla and Vargas, 2006 ). They also account
for a signiﬁcant proportion of the genes observed in the
marinemetagenome.Branchedchainaminoacidtransportersa re
probably an important marine adaptation because accumulated
glutamate may function as a counter ion for K+, which balances
the electrical state of the cytoplasm ( Penn and Jensen, 2012 ).
Previousstudieshavereportedaregulatoryrelationshipbe tween
K+and glutamate accumulation in response to osmotic stress
in enteric bacteria and haloalkaliphilic archaea Natronococcus
occultus (Kokoeva et al., 2002 ). Similarly, T. consotensis, a
halotolerant bacterium accumulates glutamate to maintain
electrical equilibrium within the cell in response to high sa lt
concentrations( Rubiano-Labradoretal.,2015 ).Thisbackground
information explains the possible physiological role of the
BCAA_ABCTPgeneof pSSR1toincreasehostosmotolerance.
Glucose/Sorbosonedehydrogenase(G SDH)isresponsiblefor
theproductionofNADPHthroughoxidativecleavageofglucos e
(Oubrieetal.,1999 ).Undersaltstresscondition,NADPHactsas
reducing potential for output of reduced glutathione (GSH) an d
involvedinactivityofmembraneboundNADPHoxidase,which
results in accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) (Wang
et al., 2008 ). H2O2acts as a signal in regulating G6PDH activity
and expression of this enzyme in the glutathione cycle throug h
which the ability of GSH regeneration was increased under sa lt
stress (Wang et al., 2008 ). Thus, G6PDH plays a critical role
in maintaining cellular GSH levels under long-term salt str ess
conditions ( Wang et al., 2008 ). It indicates that GSDHofpSSR4
is involved in salt stress tolerance possibly through the cyt osolic
accumulationofreducingequivalents(NADPHandGSH).
While in case of pSSR6only one ORFwas identiﬁed,
sharing homology with Serine/Threonine kinases. This enco ded
protein also possesses two conserved domains for the protein
family STKc_PknB, i.e. the catalytic domain of bacterial
Serine/Threonine kinases, PknB and similar proteins; STKs
and TOMM_kin_cyc, i.e., TOMM system kinase/cyclase fusion
protein. STKs are well known for activating genetic locus
concerned with osmosensing ( Hatzios et al., 2013 ) and inducing
topological changes such as DNA supercoiling ( Gupta et al.,
2014). These osmosensing signal and DNA supercoiling could
initiate uptake of the osmolyte glycine betaine, proline ( Csonka,
1989) or initiates the expression of genetic elements required tocope with osmotic stress ( Higgins et al., 1988 ). This could be
the possible mechanism by which putative STK_PknB of pSSR6
mightbeextendingosmotolerancetothehost E.coli.
ThepSSR21 ORF2 encodes a protein sharing homology
with a hypothetical protein of Candidatus Handelsmanbacteria
possessing a conserved domain for DUF3445 superfamily,
i.e., an uncharacterized protein family having conserved RLP
sequencemotif( Batemanetal.,2010 ).However,itsphysiological
characterization and intracellular ion concentration anal ysis
indicates that it extends host osmotolerance property by
maintaining low intracellular ion concentration even in th e
presenceofanionicstressor.However,adetailedmechanism still
needstobeelucidated.
CONCLUSION
In this study, the functional metagenomic approach was
used to decipher salt stress tolerant genes in the saline soil
microbiome. Identiﬁcation of salt tolerant genes BCAA_ABCtp ,
GSDH STK_Pknb, andduf3445has enriched our understanding
aboutthesurvivabilityandadaptabilityofmicrobesintheh ighly
