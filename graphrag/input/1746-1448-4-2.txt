Abstract
Halophiles are found in all three domains of life. Within the Bacteria we know halophiles within the
phyla Cyanobacteria , Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , Spirochaetes , and Bacteroidetes . Within
the Archaea the most salt-requiring mi croorganisms are found in the class Halobacteria .
Halobacterium and most of its relatives require over 100–150 g/l salt for growth and structural
stability. Also within the order Methanococci we encounter halophilic sp ecies. Halophiles and non-
halophilic relatives ar e often found together in the phylogeneti c tree, and many genera, families and
orders have representatives wi th greatly different salt requi rement and tolerance. A few
phylogenetically coherent groups co nsist of halophiles only: the order Halobacteriales , family
Halobacteriaceae (Euryarchaeota ) and the anaerobic fermenta tive bacteria of the order
Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes ). The family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria ) almost exclusively
contains halophiles. Ha lophilic microorganisms use two stra tegies to balance their cytoplasm
osmotically with their medium. The first involves  accumulation of molar concentrations of KCl.
This strategy requires adaptation of the intrac ellular enzymatic machinery, as proteins should
maintain their proper conformation and activi ty at near-saturating salt concentrations. The
proteome of such organisms is highly acidic, an d most proteins denature when suspended in low
salt. Such microorganisms genera lly cannot survive in low salt me dia. The second strategy is to
exclude salt from the cytoplasm and to synthesize and/or accumulate organi c 'compatible' solutes
that do not interfere with enzyma tic activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are needed,
and organisms using the 'organic-solutes-in stra tegy' often adapt to a surprisingly broad salt
concentration range. Most halophilic Bacteria, but also the halophilic me thanogenic Archaea use
such organic solutes. A variety of  such solutes are known, includ ing glycine betaine, ectoine and
other amino acid derivatives, sugars and sugar alco hols. The 'high-salt-in strategy' is not limited to
the Halobacteriaceae . The Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes ) also accumulate salt rather than organic
solutes. A third, phylogeneticall y unrelated organism accumulates KCl: the red extremely halophilic
Salinibacter (Bacteroidetes ), recently isolated from saltern crys tallizer brines. Analysis of its genome
showed many points of resemblance with the Halobacteriaceae , probably resulting from extensive
horizontal gene tran sfer. The case of Salinibacter shows that more unusual types of halophiles may
be waiting to be discovered.Published: 15 April 2008

At the symposium on 'General & Applied Aspects of Halo-
philic Microorganisms', held in Alicante, Spain in Septem-ber 1989, Hans Trüper presented a lecture entitled:"Halophily, taxonomy, phylogeny and nomenclature".The talk summarized different aspects of the taxonomy ofhalophilic microorganisms, the phylogenetic position of
the different types of halophiles within the microbial
world, and the physiology of the diverse groups ofextreme and moderate halophiles. An attempt was madeto detect consistent patterns and correlations between thephylogeny of halophilic microorganisms and the waysthey cope with the high salt concentrations in the environ-
ment in which they live. A summary of this talk was pub-
lished three years later in the proceedings volume of theAlicante meeting [1], and there Prof. Trüper and his cow-orkers presented a critical analysis of the data. They noteda few regular patterns that link the physiological proper-ties of the halophilic organisms with their phylogeneticposition. Four such general observations were presented:
(1) "All eubacteria that gain energy from photosynthesis
or oxygen-respiration and are capable of haloadaptation,are able to accumulate and/or produce compatible sol-utes."
(2) "Archaeobacteria and anaerobic fermenting eubacte-
ria are incapable of synthesizing organic compatible sol-utes."
(3) "Most eubacteria that can grow in non-complex media
are capable of ectoine biosynthesis."
(4) "Extreme halophily in non-fermenting eubacteria is
usually accompanied by glycine betaine biosynthesis. Thecomplete de novo synthesis of betaine from carbon diox-ide or simple organic carbon compounds has only beenproven for cyanobacteria, Ectothiorhodospira species and
Actinopolyspora halophila ."
In the eighteen years that have passed since the Alicante
meeting our understanding of the salt-loving microbialworld has greatly increased. A large number of new halo-philic organisms have been discovered and described,including organisms phylogenetically unaffiliated to pre-
viously known halophilic or halotolerant microorgan-
isms. We have also obtained a deeper insight into thephysiological mechanisms used by different types of halo-philes to adapt to life in hypersaline environments.
Based on the key words in the title of Prof. Trüper's talk –
"halophily", "taxonomy", "phylogeny" and "nomencla-
ture", this paper first presents an overview of the novelinformation, followed by a reevaluation of the fourabove-cited general observations made in 1989.Halophily and the phylogenetic tree of life
Salt dependence and salt tolerance are phenotypic charac-teristics generally included in the 'polyphasic' characteri-zation of newly discovered microorganisms toward theirdescription as new taxa with new names and the determi-nation of their position within the microbial taxonomy.There is no sharp definition of the term 'halophilic' – 'salt-
loving'. Some use the term for all organisms that require
some level of salt for growth, including concentrationsaround 35 g/l as found in seawater. This is also reflectedin prokaryote nomenclature: there are quite a few bacteriawith the specific epithet ' halophilus ' (-a, -um) that are of
marine origin and do not tolerate salt concentrations
much above those of seawater. Examples are Aestuarii-
bacter halophilus , Algoriphagus halophilus (Hongiella halo-
phila ), Arcobacter halophilus , Microbacterium halophilum ,
and Terribacillus halophilus . The use of the specific epithet
halophilus to describe marine microorganisms should be
discouraged, and it is recommended to reserve this namefor true halophiles adapted to life in hypersaline condi-
tions.
A survey of the salt relationships – the minimum salt con-
centration required for growth, the salinity optimum, andthe upper salt limit tolerated – within the microbial worldshows a continuum of properties, which makes it nearly
impossible to define by sharp boundaries what a halo-
phile is. Moreover, the minimum, optimum and maxi-mum salt concentrations often depend on the mediumcomposition and growth temperature. The most widelyused definitions were formulated thirty years ago byDonn Kushner [2] who distinguished different categories:
extreme halophiles (growing best in media containing
2.5–5.2 M salt), borderline extreme halophiles (growingbest is media containing 1.5–4.0 M salt), moderate halo-philes (growing best in media containing 0.5–2.5 M salt),and halotolerant microorganisms that do not show anabsolute requirement for salt for growth but grow well up
to often very high salt concentrations (considered
extremely halotolerant if the growth range extends above2.5 M salt). These and similar definitions have proved val-uable in the classification of microorganisms according totheir relationship to salt [3-5]. For the discussions belowa simpler operative definition of what a halophile is willsuffice: microorganisms that grow optimally at salt con-
centrations of 50 g/l (equivalent to 0.85 M NaCl) or
higher, and tolerate 100 g/l salt (equivalent to 1.7 MNaCl) at least.
When examining the distribution of halophiles, as based
on the above definition, within the small subunit rRNA
sequence-based phylogenetic tree of life, it is clear that
halophiles are found in all three kingdoms: Archaea, Bac-teria, and Eukarya (Fig. 1) [3,4,6]. The figure indicateswhich groups of microorganisms contain halophilic rep-Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2

(page number not for citation purposes)resentatives. Groups marked as such do not necessarily
consist solely of halophiles. The opposite is true: there are
only a few phylogenetically consistent groups that are
composed entirely of halophiles (see below). In most
cases halophiles and non-halophilic relatives are found
together in the phylogenetic tree, and many genera, fami-
lies and orders have representatives with greatly different
salt requirement and tolerance. Within the Archaea we
find the most salt-requiring microorganisms in the order
Halobacteriales , which contains a single family, the Halo-
bacteriaceae . Halobacterium and most of its relatives require
over 100–150 g/l salt for growth and structural stability.
Also within the class Methanothermea (Methanococci ),
order Methanosarcinales we encounter halophilic or highly
halotolerant representatives (genera Methanohalophilus ,
Methanohalobium ). All these belong to the phylum Euryar-
chaeota ; no halophilic representatives have yet been iden-
tified within the Crenarchaeota . Halophily is widespread
in the bacterial kingdom: we know halophiles within the
phyla Cyanobacteria , Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacte-
ria, Spirochaetes , and Bacteroidetes .
With a few notable exceptions, the eukaryotic microor-
ganisms form a sadly neglected group as far as the study of
their distribution in high-salt environments and their
physiological adaptation to life at high salt concentrationsis concerned. The unicellular green algae of the genus
Dunaliella have been investigated in-depth, as they are the
main or sole primary producers in many hypersaline envi-
ronments, they have become a popular model system for
the study of salt adaptation by using organic osmotic
'compatible' solutes, and they have also found biotechno-
logical applications [7]. The occurrence of the brine
shrimp ( Artemia salina , Artemia franciscana ) in salt lakes is
also well known, but the discussion of its biology is out-
side the scope of this review. The Fungi, long neglected in
halophile research, contain a number of representatives
that by all criteria are true halophiles, both by their abso-
lute requirement for high salt and by their ability to grow
up to salt concentrations approaching saturation. Exam-
ples are the meristematic fungus Trimmatostroma salinum
[8] and the black yeast Hortaea werneckii [9], organisms
indigenous to saltern brines and other hypersaline envi-
ronments. Even more severely neglected is the study of
flagellate, ciliate and amoeboid protozoa that live in high-
salt environments. The existence of such organisms has
been documented already long ago [[10,11]; for an over-
view of the early literature see [12]), but only recently has
the study of truly halophilic heterotrophic nanoflagellates
taken off. Different types of halophilic flagellates were
found in Korean saltern ponds [13], and two species have
thus far been characterized in-depth. The first is Pleurosto-The universal phylogenetic tree of life as based on small subunit rRNA gene sequences , and the distribution of halophilic micro - organisms within the treeFigure 1

riales consist entirely of halophiles. The tree is base d on Fig. 11.16 in Madigan and Martinko, 2006 (78).

1930s. An isolate from a saltern pond with 313 g/l salt has
its optimum at 300 g/l salt and does not grow below150–200 g/l [14]. Another bacteriovorous heterotrophicnanoflagellate isolated from a 300 g/l saltern pond isHalocafetaria seosinensis , which grows optimally at 150 g/l
salt, does not grow below 75 g/l, and tolerates concentra-
tions above 350 g/l total dissolved salts [15].
The Halobacteriales , the Halomonadaceae , and the 
Halanaerobiales : three phylogenetica lly coherent groups 
of halophiles
Within the small subunit rRNA gene sequence-based tree
of life we find three groups of prokaryotes that are both
phylogenetically and physiologically coherent and consistentirely or almost entirely of halophiles. Within the Eur-
yarchaeota we encounter the order Halobacteriales with a
single family, the Halobacteriaceae [16]. In the bacterial
kingdom, the family Halomonadaceae (class Gammaproteo-
bacteria , order Oceanospirillales ) predominantly contains
halophiles [17]. Members of the Halobacteriaceae and the
Halomonadaceae are aerobic heterotrophs, some of which
have a limited potential for anaerobic growth. The thirdphylogenetically coherent group contains the anaerobicfermentative bacteria of the order Halanaerobiales (Firmi-
cutes , families Halanaerobiaceae and Halobacteroidaceae )
[18].
Our understanding of the phylogenetic and physiological
diversity within the Halobacteriaceae and the Halomonad-
aceae has greatly increased in the past two decades. Exten-
sive programs aimed at the sampling of salt lakes and
other saline and hypersaline environments in different
countries have led to the characterization and taxonomicdescription of many new species, so that the number ofspecies names within these two families has increasedexponentially. The 1974 edition of 'Bergey's Manual ofDeterminative Bacteriology' listed 2 genera and 3 species
within the family Halobacteriaceae [19]. The next edition
of the handbook, published in 1989 under the new name'Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology', already had6 genera and 11 species [20]. The numbers of genera andspecies increased to 14 and 34, respectively in the 2001edition [21], and to date (March 2008) the names of noless than 26 genera and 91 different species of Halobacte-
riaceae have been validly published under the rules of the
International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Fig.2, upper panel). With descriptions of eight additional newspecies listed as 'in press' in the International Journal ofSystematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (as of March 2,2008), the current trend is expected to continue at least for
some more time.
Most species of Halobacteriaceae are true extreme halo-
philes according to Kushner's definition [2]. However,analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from environments
with salt concentrations below 100 g/l shows that the
lower salinity boundary that allows development ofarchaeal halophiles may be substantially lower than thatof Halobacterium salinarum , Haloarcula marismortui , and
other well-studied members of the group [22]. Descrip-tions of isolates phylogenetically affiliated with the Halo-
bacteriaceae but with a relatively low salt requirement also
started to appear in the literature. A saline spring in Okla-homa whose waters contain 7–10 g/l salt, a concentrationfar too low to support growth of most members of theHalobacteriaceae , recently yielded a novel species of Halof-
erax, Haloferax sulfurifontis [23] and two species belonging
to new genera: Haladaptatus paucihalophilus (the specific
epithet signifying its low salt requirement) [24] andHalosarcina pallida [25]. The lower salinity boundary of
these species for growth is 60, 47, and 76 g/l, respectively,but the optimal salt concentrations and the maximalsalinity tolerated by these isolates are within the highranges normally encountered for members of the family.
Halobacterium salinarum and most other species of Halo-
bacteriaceae lyse when the salt concentration is lowered
below 100 g/l. However, some of its relatives have aremarkable ability to withstand exposure to low salt con-centrations. Out of 131 isolates of Halobacteriaceae
obtained from Spanish saltern ponds, 49 did not lyse in
20 g/l salt and 13 even survived exposure to 10 g/l salt
[26]. It was recently shown that isolates obtained fromJapanese salterns and affiliated with the genera Halococcus ,
Halogeometricum and Haladaptatus may survive periods of
1–9 days in salt solutions of seawater concentration [27].Haloferax sulfurifontis survived incubation for 24 h at
10–20 g/l salt and 72 h in 30 g/l salt [23], and 
Haladapta-
tus paucihalophilus cells even retained their viability after
having been suspended for two weeks in distilled water[24]. The sediments of a British salt marsh yielded severalisolates of Halobacteriaceae , many of which closely related
to Haladaptatus paucihalophilus , which grow slowly at sea-
water salinity [28].
It must be realized that there is no well-based species con-
cept for the prokaryotes, and the same is therefore true forthe halophilic Archaea. The above-presented statistics ofthe number of species described are all based on somemore or less arbitrary ideas of how to define a species and
when to decide whether a new isolate may belong to an
already known species or should be described as a novelone. A recent evaluation of a large number of isolates ofHalobacteriaceae from saltern ponds in Spain and Algeria
using multilocus sequence analysis shows that, althoughclusters can be defined by concatenation of multiple
marker sequences, barriers to exchange between them are
leaky. No nonarbitrary way to circumscribe 'species' istherefore likely to emerge for the Halobacteriaceae in the
near future [29].Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2

(page number not for citation purposes)A dramatic increase in the number of descriptions of new
species in recent years can also be observed for the second
phylogenetic group that consists (almost) entirely of halo-philes: the family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria ).
When Halomonas elongata was isolated in 1980 [30], few
people predicted that it would be the first representativeof a very large group of metabolically versatile moderate
halophiles. The recognition that Halomonas and relatives
deserve to be classified in a separate family came in 1988[31], and the number of species and genera has been ris-ing steadily since ([5,32,33]; Fig. 2, middle panel).Recently two new genera were added to the family, Halo-
talea and Modicisalibacter [34,35], bringing the census for
March 2008 to 7 genera with 63 species whose names
have been validly published. Out of these 63 species, 60can be considered halophiles as based on the above defi-nition. The three genera Zymomonas , Carnimonas , and
Cobetia each contain presently one non-halophilic or
marine species. As of March 2, 2008, four new species ofthe genus Halomonas were listed as 'in press' in the Inter-
national Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbi-
ology.
The third phylogenetically coherent group consisting
entirely of halophiles is the interesting but little studiedorder Halanaerobiales , families Halanaerobiaceae and Halo-
bacteroidaceae (Low G+C branch of the Firmicutes ) [18].
This group consists of obligate anaerobes, and most liveby fermentation of sugars or (in a few cases only) aminoacids. That the study of this group has to some extent beenneglected in comparison with the other halophilebranches is obvious from the number of new species
described: the count for March 2008 was 11 genera and 24
species (Fig. 2, lower panel), the two most recently addedgenera and species – Halonatronum saccharophilum and
Selenihalanaerobacter shriftii having been described in
2001. The latter species is of special interest as it makes aliving by anaerobic respiration rather than by fermenta-
tion [36]. The family Halanaerobiaceae also contains a
thermophilic representative: Halothermothrix orenii , an
organism isolated from a hypersaline lake in Tunisia thatcombines anaerobic life at high salt (optimum 100 g/l,tolerating up to 200 g/l salt) with a high temperature opti-mum (60°C, growing up to 68°C) [37].
Mechanisms of adaptation of halophilic microorganisms 
to life at high salt
Trüper's four 'postulates', as presented at the Alicante sym-
posium [1], deal with the presence, distribution and bio-synthesis of organic osmotic solutes, and they mentionspecific compounds such as ectoine and glycine betaine.
A basic property of all halophilic microorganisms is the
fact that their cytoplasm has to be at least isoosmotic withtheir surrounding medium. Biological membranes arepermeable to water, and active energy-dependent inward
transport of water to compensate for water lost by osmotic
processes is energetically not feasible. Moreover, cells thatkeep a turgor need even to maintain their intracellularosmotic pressure higher than that of their environment[38,39].
There are two fundamentally different strategies used by
halophilic microorganisms to balance their cytoplasmosmotically with their medium. The first involves accu-mulation of molar concentrations of potassium and chlo-ride. This strategy requires extensive adaptation of theintracellular enzymatic machinery to the presence of salt,
as the proteins should maintain their proper conforma-
tion and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations[40]. The proteome of such organisms is highly acidic,and most proteins denature when suspended in low salt.Such 'high-salt-in strategy' microorganisms generally can-not survive in low salt media.
Although it can be calculated that the 'high-salt-in strat-
egy' is energetically less costly to the cell than the biosyn-thesis of large amounts of organic osmotic solutes [41],this strategy is not widely used among the different phyl-ogenetic and physiological groups of halophiles (Fig. 3).It is best known from the extremely halophilic Archaea of
the family Halobacteriaceae , and species such as Halobacte-
rium salinarum and Haloarcula marismortui have become
popular model organisms to examine the implicationsthat the maintenance of high intracellular KCl concentra-tions has on the life of a cell. Our understanding of thebiology of the Halobacteriaceae has greatly increased in
recent years thanks to the elucidation and analysis of the
genome sequences of Halobacterium NRC-1 [42,43],
Haloarcula marismortui [44], Natronomonas pharaonis [45],
and Halquadratum walsbyi [46].
The strategy of salt adaptation is not limited to the aerobic
halophilic Archaea. The anaerobic fermentative Halanaer-
obiales (Bacteria, Firmicutes ) also use KCl rather than
organic solutes to osmotically balance their cytoplasm,and they also have adapted their intracellular machineryto tolerate the presence of salt [18,47]. The third type oforganism, phylogenetically unrelated with the above-mentioned two groups, in which the 'high-salt-in-strategy'
was recently identified to occur, is the aerobic red
extremely halophilic Salinibacter ruber (Bacteroidetes ). The
properties of this intriguing organism are discussed belowin further depth.
Far more widespread in nature is the second strategy of
haloadaptation, based on the biosynthesis and/or accu-
mulation of organic osmotic solutes. Cells that use thisstrategy exclude salt from their cytoplasm as much as pos-sible. The high concentrations of organic 'compatible' sol-Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2
Page 7 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)utes do not greatly interfere with normal enzymatic
activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are there-
fore needed. Such organisms can often adapt to a surpris-
ingly broad salt concentration range [5]. The list of
organic compounds that have been shown to serve as
osmotic solutes in halophilic microorganisms – prokary-
otic as well as eukaryotic – is extensive. Most compatible
solutes are based on amino acids and amino acid deriva-
tives, sugars, or sugar alcohols [48-50]. Most are either
uncharged or zwitterionic (Fig. 4).
Use of the 'low-salt-in strategy' of haloadaptation with
accumulation of organic osmotic solutes is widespread in
the small subunit rRNA sequence-based phylogenetic tree
of life (Fig. 5). Not all groups of halophiles have yet been
examined for the occurrence and distribution of organic
solutes. For example, no information is available on the
composition and concentrations of intracellular solutes
within the recently characterized extremely halophilic
flagellate protozoa [14,15]. We do, however, have a quite
complete picture of the distribution of organic solutes in
most other groups of halophilic microorganisms. Glyc-
erol and other polyols are widely used for osmotic adap-
tation in halophilic eukaryotic algae and fungi, but onlyseldom in the the prokaryotes, the finding of mannitol in
Pseudomonas putida [51] being a notable exception. The
occurrence of certain other solutes in halophilic and halo-
tolerant prokaryotes is also often correlated with their
position in the phylogenetic tree of life.
Within the domain Archaea we find a few solutes not yet
detected elsewhere within the tree [49]. Halophilic meth-
anogens such as the Methanohalophilus species contain, in
addition to glycine betaine found widespread in nature, β-
amino acids and derivatives that are rarely found in other
groups: β-glutamine, β-glutamate, and N ε-acetyl-β-lysine
([49,52]; for a report on the occurrence of β-glutamate in
the domain Bacteria see [53]). Sulfotrehalose has thus far
been found only in a few alkaliphilic members of the
Halobacteriaceae ; it is accumulated in substantial concen-
trations (up to 1 M) in addition to KCl which serves as the
main osmotic solute like in their neutrophilic relatives
[54].
In the kingdom Bacteria the largest diversity of organic
solutes is detected. Some compounds appear to be used
by a wide range of organisms. Glycine betaine is readily
used as osmotic solute by many different types [55], butDistribution within the phylogenetic tree  of microorganisms accumulating KCl as their sole or main osmotic solute Figure 3

obiales within the low G+C branch, consisting  of anaerobic fermentati ve organisms) and different halophilic aerobes ( Halobacil-
lus spp. and others) that accumulate inor ganic solutes. High intrac ellular KCl concentrations are also found in the 
methanogenic halophiles,  but these accumulate organic solutes as well.

(page number not for citation purposes)only when it can be taken up from the medium. Relatively
few prokaryotes are capable of de novo synthesis of the
compound. Notably these are different types of pho-
totrophs: halophilic cyanobacteria as well as anoxygenic
phototrophs such as Halorhodospira spp. Occurrence of
glycine betaine biosynthesis in the heterotrophic Actinop-
olyspora halophila (Actinobacteria ) has been established
long ago. In recent years the list of non-phototrophic
prokaryotes capable of de novo production of glycine
betaine as regulated by the extracellular salt concentration
has grown. The methanogenic archaeon Methanohalo-
philus portucalensis synthesizes glycine betaine by reductive
methylation of glycine that is generated from serine
[50,56-59]. In contrast, the far less halotolerant Meth-
anosarcina mazei does not produce glycine betaine, but
accumulates the compound from the medium when
exposed to salt stress. Recently evidence was obtained for
de novo biosynthesis of glycine betaine also in the haloal-
kaliphilic chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing Proteobacte-
ria Thioalkalibacter and Thioalkalivibrio [60,61], but no
information is as yet available about the biosynthetic
pathway used and its regulation.
Far more abundant than glycine betaine as compatible
solute in the domain Bacteria are the cyclic amino acidderivatives ectoine and hydroxyectoine, originally discov-
ered in anoxygenic phototrophs of the Ectothiorhodospira –
Halospira group [48]. Ectoine is now known to be synthe-
sized by many aerobic heterotrophic bacteria [5,49].
Ectoine was also recently identified as a major osmotic
solute in halophilic methanotrophs and methylotrophs
[62,63].
The list of organic compatible solutes that have been iden-
tified is long, and Fig. 4 gives a representative selection
only. Some compounds are widespread along the phylo-
genetic tree, while others appear to be limited to selected
groups. For example, glucosylglycerol is almost exclu-
sively found in moderately halophilic or highly halotoler-
ant cyanobacteria, but has been detected in some
pseudomonads as well [64,65]; N ε-acetyl-α-lysine and
Nδ-acetylornithine have thus far been detected only in
aerobic members of the Firmicutes . Another compound of
interest is proline, found especially in the Firmicutes
[66,67], but also present in halophilic/halotolerant dia-
toms [68]. A special biosynthetic pathway for the produc-
tion of proline for osmotic purposes has been detected in
Bacillus subtilis [69].Distribution within the phylogenetic tree  of microorganisms accumulating orga nic solutes to provide osmotic balance Figure 5

nal salt concentration, provides microorganisms with alarge degree of flexibility and the possibility to adapt to awide range of salt concentrations [5,48]. However, ener-getically the production of massive amounts of such sol-utes can be costly. In addition, energy is still needed to
prevent salts from reaching the cytoplasm. The high
energy cost involved is especially relevant for microorgan-isms that obtain small amounts of energy from the dis-similatory processes they perform. A calorimetric studywith Halomonas elongata , a bacterium that produces
ectoine as its main compatible solute, shows that the
organism has optimized its metabolism to minimize the
energetic cost of osmotic adaptation [70]. It is well possi-ble that the upper salinity at which different metabolictypes of prokaryotes are found in nature depends to alarge extent on the balance between the amount of energythat is available to the cells and the cost of production oforganic solutes needed to provide osmotic balance [41].
The case of Salinibacter , a member of the Bacteria with 
archaeal characteristics
Until recently it was generally accepted that halophilic
members of the bacterial domain use organic solutes forosmotic balance. The sole exception known was that of
the Halanaerobiales , a group of fermentative halophiles
phylogenetically affiliated with the low G+C branch of theFirmicutes . It was also clear why the 'high-salt-in strategy'
would be the preferred or possibly the only feasible modeof haloadaptation in this group: only very little energy isobtained in the fermentation pathways that provide ATP
to these organisms, and accordingly the production of
massive amounts of organic compatible solutes wouldleave insufficient energy for other cellular functions [41].
The discovery of Salinibacter and the analysis of its proper-
ties (Table 1) now require a change in our views. Salini-
bacter ruber is a red extreme halophile, phylogenetically
belonging to the Bacteroidetes branch of the Bacteria, and
it coexists with Archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae in
NaCl-saturated saltern crystallizer ponds and in otherhypersaline environments at or approaching halite satura-
tion. Its existence was first recognized in the late 1990s
based on the molecular characterization of the microbialcommunity in Spanish saltern crystallizer ponds [71]. Theisolation of the organism soon followed [72-74].
The affiliation of Salinibacter with the Bacteria appears not
only from the sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, but also
from the nature of the lipids in its membrane – bacteriallipids, in part of an unusual type, but with conventionalfatty acids rather than the archaeal phytanyl-based hydro-phobic chains [75]. The sensitivity of Salinibacter to anti-
biotics points to the presence of peptidoglycan in its cell
wall. It was therefore expected that, like all other known
halophilic and halotolerant aerobic Bacteria, Salinibacter
would contain an organic solute or a cocktail of such sol-utes. However, no significant concentrations of organicsolutes were detected. Instead, the cells contain molarconcentrations of KCl [76], and its proteome is highlyacidic, nearly as much so as the proteome of Halobacterium
[77]. Analysis of the genome of S. ruber showed many
additional common properties with the extremely halo-philic Archaea. Extensive gene exchange may haveoccurred between Salinibacter and the Halobacteriaceae ,
which share the same environment and have been subjectto the same environmental stress factors throughout their
evolutionary history [77].
Final comments
Based on all the new information that has become availa-
ble in the past two decades we can now reevaluate the four'postulates' presented by Trüper at the Alicante 1989 halo-
phile symposium [1]:
(1) "All eubacteria that gain energy from photosynthesis
or oxygen-respiration and are capable of haloadaptation,are able to accumulate and/or produce compatible sol-utes."
For the Bacteria that lead an oxygenic or anoxygenic pho-
totrophic life this statement is still true. However, the dis-covery of Salinibacter ruber , phylogenetically affiliated

(page number not for citation purposes)with the Bacteroidetes but physiologically behaving like a
member of the Halobacteriaceae , shows that the 'high-salt-
in strategy' of osmotic adaptation, based on the accumu-lation of KCl and the adaptation of the entire intracellularenzymatic machinery to the presence of high salt concen-trations, also occurs in some oxygen-respiring members ofthe domain Bacteria.
(2) "Archaeobacteria and anaerobic fermenting eubacte-
ria are incapable of synthesizing organic compatible sol-utes."
No cases of anaerobic fermenting Bacteria that produce
organic osmotic solutes have yet been documented. How-
ever, compatible solutes have been detected in severalgroups of halophilic Archaea. Methanogenic Archaea(also the non-halophilic ones) contain high concentra-tions of KCl, but in the halophilic types such as Methano-
halophilus spp. different organic solutes are known to
occur: glycine betaine, and β-amino acids and derivatives.
The intracellular concentrations of at least some of these
compounds are regulated in accordance with the salinityof the environment. Another case of organic solutes dis-covered in Archaea is that of sulfotrehalose which,together with KCl, appears to play a role in the osmoticadaptation of some haloalkaliphilic members of the Halo-
bacteriaceae .
(3) "Most eubacteria that can grow in non-complex media
are capable of ectoine biosynthesis."
Ectoine indeed appears to be the nearly universal organic
compatible solutes in the Bacteria, and its biosynthesis
has been documented in a wide variety of halophilic andhalotolerant species, and notably in species with simplegrowth demands.
(4) "Extreme halophily in non-fermenting eubacteria is
usually accompanied by glycine betaine biosynthesis. The
complete de novo synthesis of betaine from carbon diox-ide or simple organic carbon compounds has only beenproven for cyanobacteria, Ectothiorhodospira species and
Actinopolyspora halophila ."
The truly halophilic species within the genus Ectothiorho-
dospira have since been reclassified in the newly created
genus Halorhodospira . The finding of complete de novo
biosynthesis of glycine betaine in the methanogenicarchaeon Methanohalophilus portucalensis and in haloalka-
liphilic bacterial chemolithotrophs shows that produc-tion of this simple solute may be more widespread than
previously assumed.
Summarizing all these new data, it becomes ever more dif-
ficult to formulate general trends to describe the relationsbetween halophily, taxonomy, phylogeny and nomencla-
ture. The halophilic microbial world is tremendously
diverse, and novel types of halophiles are being discov-ered at an ever-increasing rate. The case of Salinibacter
ruber shows that some of these newly described organisms
may necessitate us to revise our concepts on how the dif-ferent physiological and phylogenetic groups of microor-
ganisms have solved the problem how to cope with high
salt concentrations in their environment. Hypersalineenvironments are extremely diverse, and so are the micro-organisms that inhabit them.
