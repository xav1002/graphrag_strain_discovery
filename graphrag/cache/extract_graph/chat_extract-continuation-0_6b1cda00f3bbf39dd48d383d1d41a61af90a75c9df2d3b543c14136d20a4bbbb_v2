In CETPs, tannery\nsaline wastewater was segregated generally separately and\ntreated in solar ponds to prevent degeneration of tannerysludge in the bioreactor. In order to analyze the efficiencyof the identified strains reported on treatment of tannerysaline wastewater, comparative studies were performedemploying activated tannery sludge and natural habitat\nmicrobes (those present in the raw effluent) separately.\nBatch experiments on tannery saline wastewater degrada-tion were performed at optimized growth conditions ofrespective strains as given in Table 1 (inoculum dosage(2% v/v), pH of 7.0, 37°C and at 200 rpm). The presenceof 1.7% of NaCl (by wt) showed that (table 2) tannery\nsaline wastewater was slightly saline. High TKN and BOD\nvalues further indicated the suitability of the collectedsample for biodegradability studies. In batch experiments,salt concentration was changed from 2–10% (w/v) tominimize commercial tannery saline wastewater salt com-position. Experimental runs were continued till apprecia-\nble COD removal (> 80%) was obtained. Samples were\ntaken at regular time intervals, analyzed for COD valueand chloride effects were masked by addition of HgSO\n4 in\nproportion to chloride concentration. Each set of experi-ments was repeated for three times and only mean valuesof the results were discussed. Statistical analysis (ORIGINsoftware) of results for replicas showed a minimum stand-\nard deviation range of ± 3% for most of the experiments.\n(Fig. 1 depicts the variation in COD reduction of tannerysaline wastewater salinity, 2% w/v) by salt tolerant bacte-rial isolates, mixed salt tolerant consortia and tannerysludge). A maximum degradation of 87.6% was observedfor P.aeruginosa compared to tannery sludge (68.5%).\nStudies on effect of salinity already showed that P. aerugi-\nnosa was effective in adapting to low salt concentrations (>\n5% w/v) compared with the other strains reported. Thisfinding was also reflected in the experimental resultsMicrobial Cell Factories  2008, 7:15 http://www.microbialcellfa ctories.com/content/7/1/15\nPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)obtained from biodegradation of tannery saline wastewa-\nter and confirmed that P.aeruginosa was a suitable working\nstrain for treatment of tannery effluent of low saline con-\ncentration.\nThe results obtained for treatment of tannery saline waste-\nwater at 4% (w/v) saline condition also showed P. aerugi-\nnosa to be an ideal strain. A higher COD removal (of 80%)\nwas noted as compared with other strains and mixed cul-\nture. At 4% salinity level, although it took two days for\nP.aeruginosa to values with adapt as well as achieve 80%\ndegradability, it turned out to be an effective strain (Fig.\n2). Mixed salt tolerant consortia showed 59.8% COD\nremoval at 4% (w/v) saline concentration. In both 2%\nand 4% saline concentrations, mixed consortia did notshow appreciable degradation of tannery effluent. As the\nmixed consortia had all the four identified halotolerant\nstrains, the inhibition in growth/enzyme secretion due to\ncompetition for earlier adaptation on saline wastewater\ncould have been dominant at low saline concentrations\nThis 'competition' suppressed the activity of the respective\nstrains resulting in poor performance in low salt regime.\n(Fig. 3 shows the comparative profile of COD removal in\ntannery saline wastewater by identified strains and mixed\nconsortia at 6% (w/v) saline concentration). It was\nobserved that mixed salt tolerant bacterial consortia effec-\ntively degraded tannery saline wastewater with 6% (w/v)\nsalinity level (83% degradation).\nThe above data suggest that cumulative salt tolerance\nactivity of identified isolates in the consortia was pro-\nnounced compared with individual activity of respective\nstrains. This finding further proved that mixed consortia\ncould be applied effectively for treatment and manage-\nment of moderate strength tannery saline waste stream. (A\ncomparative COD removal profile for treatment of tan-\nnery saline effluent at 8% (w/v) is given in Fig. 4). Analysis\nof results showed that E.homiense exhibited a higher COD\nremoval (90%). Mixed salt tolerant consortia also showed\nan appreciable COD removal (80%) at 8% (w/v) salinity\nconcentration, but not as efficiently as with E.homiense .\nThe individual efficiency of E.homiense to degrade tannery\nsaline wastewater could have been inhibited when it was\npresent in mixed consortia, due to substrate competition\nand initial biomass density.\nA sudden fall in COD reduction was observed for all the\nstrains (> 50%) when salinity level increased to 10% (Fig.\n5). This indicated that even a smaller increment in salinity\n(8 to 10%) could result in adverse effect on treatment effi-\nciency. From the results given in Fig. 5, it could be\nVariation in COD reduction of  tannery saline  wastewater (6% Salinity, T = 37°C, pH 7.5\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like you provided two texts and asked for output, but there is no specific question or task to perform on the text.
