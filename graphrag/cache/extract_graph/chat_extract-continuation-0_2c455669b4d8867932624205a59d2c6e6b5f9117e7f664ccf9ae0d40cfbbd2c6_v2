Another compound of\ninterest is proline, found especially in the Firmicutes\n[66,67], but also present in halophilic/halotolerant dia-\ntoms [68]. A special biosynthetic pathway for the produc-\ntion of proline for osmotic purposes has been detected in\nBacillus subtilis [69].Distribution within the phylogenetic tree  of microorganisms accumulating orga nic solutes to provide osmotic balance Figure 5\nDistribution within the phylogenetic tree of microorgan isms accumulating organic solutes to provide osmotic \nbalance.  Groups marked with red boxes contain at least some halo philic representatives in whic h de novo synthesis and/or \naccumulation of organic solutes has been demonstrated. The group of the Firmicutes contains both halophili c aerobes that accu-\nmulate organic solutes and anaerobic fe rmentative microorganisms (the order Halanaerobiales ) that use KCl.\nSaline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 10 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)Use of organic osmotic solutes, whose intracellular con-\ncentrations can be regulated in accordance with the exter-\nnal salt concentration, provides microorganisms with alarge degree of flexibility and the possibility to adapt to awide range of salt concentrations [5,48]. However, ener-getically the production of massive amounts of such sol-utes can be costly. In addition, energy is still needed to\nprevent salts from reaching the cytoplasm. The high\nenergy cost involved is especially relevant for microorgan-isms that obtain small amounts of energy from the dis-similatory processes they perform. A calorimetric studywith Halomonas elongata , a bacterium that produces\nectoine as its main compatible solute, shows that the\norganism has optimized its metabolism to minimize the\nenergetic cost of osmotic adaptation [70]. It is well possi-ble that the upper salinity at which different metabolictypes of prokaryotes are found in nature depends to alarge extent on the balance between the amount of energythat is available to the cells and the cost of production oforganic solutes needed to provide osmotic balance [41].\nThe case of Salinibacter , a member of the Bacteria with \narchaeal characteristics\nUntil recently it was generally accepted that halophilic\nmembers of the bacterial domain use organic solutes forosmotic balance. The sole exception known was that of\nthe Halanaerobiales , a group of fermentative halophiles\nphylogenetically affiliated with the low G+C branch of theFirmicutes . It was also clear why the 'high-salt-in strategy'\nwould be the preferred or possibly the only feasible modeof haloadaptation in this group: only very little energy isobtained in the fermentation pathways that provide ATP\nto these organisms, and accordingly the production of\nmassive amounts of organic compatible solutes wouldleave insufficient energy for other cellular functions [41].\nThe discovery of Salinibacter and the analysis of its proper-\nties (Table 1) now require a change in our views. Salini-\nbacter ruber is a red extreme halophile, phylogenetically\nbelonging to the Bacteroidetes branch of the Bacteria, and\nit coexists with Archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae in\nNaCl-saturated saltern crystallizer ponds and in otherhypersaline environments at or approaching halite satura-\ntion. Its existence was first recognized in the late 1990s\nbased on the molecular characterization of the microbialcommunity in Spanish saltern crystallizer ponds [71]. Theisolation of the organism soon followed [72-74].\nThe affiliation of Salinibacter with the Bacteria appears not\nonly from the sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, but also\nfrom the nature of the lipids in its membrane – bacteriallipids, in part of an unusual type, but with conventionalfatty acids rather than the archaeal phytanyl-based hydro-phobic chains [75]. The sensitivity of Salinibacter to anti-\nbiotics points to the presence of peptidoglycan in its cell\nwall. It was therefore expected that, like all other known\nhalophilic and halotolerant aerobic Bacteria, Salinibacter\nwould contain an organic solute or a cocktail of such sol-utes. However, no significant concentrations of organicsolutes were detected. Instead, the cells contain molarconcentrations of KCl [76], and its proteome is highlyacidic, nearly as much so as the proteome of Halobacterium\n[77]. Analysis of the genome of S. ruber showed many\nadditional common properties with the extremely halo-philic Archaea. Extensive gene exchange may haveoccurred between Salinibacter and the Halobacteriaceae ,\nwhich share the same environment and have been subjectto the same environmental stress factors throughout their\nevolutionary history [77].\nFinal comments\nBased on all the new information that has become availa-\nble in the past two decades we can now reevaluate the four'postulates' presented by Trüper at the Alicante 1989 halo-\nphile symposium [1]:\n(1) \"All eubacteria that gain energy from photosynthesis\nor oxygen-respiration and are capable of haloadaptation,are able to accumulate and/or produce compatible sol-utes.\"\nFor the Bacteria that lead an oxygenic or ano\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you have provided a scientific article about microorganisms that live in high-salt environments.
