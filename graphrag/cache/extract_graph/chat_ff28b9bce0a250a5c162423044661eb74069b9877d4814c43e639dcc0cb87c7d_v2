In addition, it highlights \nthe significant contribution of modern biotechnology in \nenhancing salt tolerance in STPs. Importantly, this review \nemphasizes the wide range of applications of STPs in \nhigh-salt traditional soybean fermented foods and offers \ninsights into the future development of microbial-derived \nSTPs. By consolidating this information, this review aims \nto provide a valuable resource for researchers to identify gaps in knowledge concerning the process of isolating \nand purifying microbial-derived STPs, improving their \nperformance, and exploring their applications in tradi -\ntional fermented foods.\nStudy on microorganisms producing STPs\nMicroorganisms producing STPs\nMicroorganisms producing STPs primarily include bac -\nteria, fungi, and some archaea. Table  1 collects infor -\nmation on some microbial-derived STPs reported since \n2015. Notably, the strains have been isolated from vari -\nous high-salt environments such as saline soils, seawa -\nter, lakes, and marine sediments, and used in various \nindustries (Daoud et  al. 2018; Flores-Santos et  al. 2020; \nFoophow et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2020). STPs produced by \ndifferent microorganisms differ not only in salt tolerance, \nbut also in structure and enzymatic properties such as \nthe optimum temperature, pH, and metal ion inhibition. \nThese differences in structure and properties directly \ninfluence the range of industrial applications for these \nSTPs (Chung et  al. 2022; Falkenberg et  al. 2022; Yang \net al. 2020). The alkaline protease from the halotolerant \nalkaliphilic Bacillus  sp. strain NPST-AK15 can remain sta -\nble in NaCl up to 20% (w/v). The optimum pH and tem -\nperature for the enzyme are 10.5 and 60 °C, respectively. \nWhen pre-incubated with some commercial detergents \nat 40 °C for 1 h, it retains the initial activity of 75–100%. \nThese results suggest that it may play a significant role in \ncommercial detergents (Ibrahim et  al. 2015a). Similarly, \nalkaline proteases used in detergent formulations have \nbeen reported to be active at concentrations up to 4  M \nNaCl, with enhanced activity in the presence of  CaCl2, \nKCl, and  MnCl2 (Mokashe et  al. 2017). However, the \noptimum pH and temperature are 8.5 and 55 °C, respec -\ntively, which are lower than those of the alkaline protease \nfrom Bacillus  sp. strain NPST-AK15. Most of the reported \nSTPs from microorganisms are alkaline proteases, while \nreports of salt-tolerant neutral proteases and acid pro -\nteases are few (Table  1). The salt-tolerant neutral pro -\ntease from Aspergillus oryzae CICIM F0899 has shown \nhigh salt tolerance in 18% NaCl and can maintain 72% of \nits initial activity after 14 days (Wang et al. 2013). It has \npromising applications in soy sauce production. The acid \nprotease from Rhodotorula mucilaginosa L7 can main -\ntain 60% activity in 3.5  M NaCl concentration, and its \noptimum pH and temperature are 5.0 and 50 °C, respec -\ntively (Lario et al. 2015). This protease may lead to poten -\ntial biotechnological applications.\nTable 1\nHalophytic bacteria, known for their ability to thrive \nand reproduce in high-salt environments, have been Page 4 of 23 Yao et al.
