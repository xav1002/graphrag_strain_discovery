Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \n \nof salt-tolerant Bacillus  sp.  LCB10 has been expressed in \nE. coli, leading to highly salt-tolerant proteases (Hou et al. \n2019). The enzyme maintains 86% activity in the presence \nof 7% NaCl. With the development of bioinformatics, \ngenetic engineering techniques are often combined with \nmulti-omics techniques to reveal the salt tolerance mech -\nanisms of STPs and to identify the coding and regulatory \ngenes of microbial STPs. This strategy can increase the \nchances of discovering new enzymes and enzymes with \nspecial functions. These genes are re-fused, recombined, \nand induced to be expressed in E. coli, Bacillus , and other \nmicroorganisms to improve enzyme production and tol -\nerance. For instance, coding genes from the peptidase \nS8A subfamily, which has a high ability to hydrolyze pro -\nteins, have been screened from the krill metagenomic \nlibrary using metagenomic techniques (Sun et al. 2020). \nSubsequently, these genes are expressed in E. coli, result -\ning in the generation of proteases with remarkable salt \ntolerance. These proteases retain 40% of their residual \nactivity when stored in 3  M NaCl, as demonstrated in \nprevious studies (Purohit and Singh 2013). These STPs \nhave great potential for various industrial applications.\nEnzyme immobilization techniques involve immo -\nbilizing enzymes on carriers (such as gel, resin, fiber, \nand metal) to form immobilized catalysts (Ibra -\nhim et  al. 2021; Motamedi et  al. 2021; Rahman et  al. \n2016). Adsorption, covalent binding, cross-linking, \nand entrapment are the four main methods of enzyme \nimmobilization (Dong et  al. 2022; Motamedi et  al. \n2021). These methods not only enhance the catalytic \nefficiency of the enzyme, facilitating its recovery and \nreuse, but also enhance its activity and stability (Dong \net al. 2022). To improve protease stability, extracellular \nSTPs from Bacillus  sp. DL-1 have been immobilized \nby diatomite adsorption and can retain approximately \n35.8% of their activity after six repetitions (Dong et al. \n2022). In contrast to free proteases, the alkaline pro -\ntease from Salipaludibacillus agaradhaerens immo -\nbilized on mesoporous core–shell nanoparticles not \nonly maintains high enzyme activity at high tempera -\ntures and low pH, but has been shown to significantly \nimprove enzyme stability against high concentrations \nof NaCl, organic solvents, surfactants, and commer -\ncial detergents (Ibrahim et  al. 2021). However, some \nenzymes may decrease or lose activity after immo -\nbilization using these conventional immobilization \ntechniques due to mass transfer limitations and unfa -\nvorable conformations between the enzyme and sub -\nstrate (Altinkaynak et  al. 2016; Hanefeld et  al. 2013). \nUsing a hybrid nanoflower technique, enzymes can be \nimmobilized by employing proteases and metal ions \nas organic and inorganic components. This method is highly effective in enhancing the catalytic activity and \nstability of enzymes, even under harsh conditions such \nas high salt concentrations, extreme pH levels, and \ntemperature changes (Altinkaynak et  al. 2016). This \nnew immobilization technique has been applied to pro -\nteases, including trypsin (Lin et al. 2014), papain (Liang \net al. 2015), and chymotrypsin (Yin et al. 2015). These \ncases suggest that these techniques for immobilizing \nenzymes can be used as potential future approaches for \nimproving the salt tolerance of proteases.\nWith the development of bioinformatics and the \ncontinuous improvement of biological databases (such \nas protein information resource and protein sequence \ndatabase), the use of computer-aided rational design \nof enzyme molecules has gradually gained favor with \nresearchers (Ashraf et  al. 2019; Xi et  al. 2022; Zhang \net  al. 2022c ). These methods mainly include directed \nevolution, rational design, and ab initio design (Ashraf \net al. 2019). These methods can modify the amino acid \nsequence (e.g., the surface charge) of proteins by point \nmutations, insertions, substitutions, and deletions, thus \nenabling engineered modifications of proteases and \nenhancing their salt tolerance. Previous studies have \nreported site-directed mutagenesis of eight site-specific \nmutations on the surface of moderately salt-tolerant \nserine proteases from Bacillus subtilis, yielding several \nmutants with substituted aspartic acid and arginine \nresidues (Takenaka et al. 2022). The salt tolerance of the \nthree mutants is 1.2 times higher than that of the wild \ntype. Multiple substitutions of these amino acid resi -\ndues may alter the ratio of negative to positive charges \non the protease surface, thereby increasing the hydra -\ntion and solubility of the protease surface at high salt \nconcentrations, and improving the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bdbfa0ac14c26054b10d1ee4338c64b5d110ccc7d80a4aa58074b8bc4176bb7e_v2"}
