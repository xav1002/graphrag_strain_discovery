Much attention has been paid to the proper \ndefinition of these terms [6-8] and it is not our \nintention to add to the confusion. While it is \ncertainly justified to define a halophilic organism \nas one requiring salt and displaying a growth \noptimum well above marine concentrations (>> \n3%), the definition of halotolerance imposes a \nproblem, especially as the degree of tolerance \nobserved largely depends on the composition of \nthe growth medium. We therefore propose to \ndistinguish between organisms tolerating salt due \nto intrinsic protection mechanisms and 'acquired' \nhalotolerance based on the accumulation of pro- \ntectants from the environment. \nThe spectrum of species found in saline \nbiotopes is dominated by microbial (mostly \nprokaryotic) forms of life. The primary producers \nare algae (mainly of the genus Dunaliella) [9], \ncyanobacteria (e.g. Aphanothece halophytica, \nDactylococcopsis salina, Spirulina platensis, Syne- \nchococcus and Synechocystis species) [10,11] and \nanoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (e.g. Ectothio- \nrhodospira halophila, E. halochloris, E. abdel- \nmalekii, E. marismortui, Rhodospirillum salexigens, \nR. salinarum) [12-17]. The spectrum of chemoor- \nganoheterotrophic organisms comprises the well \nknown conspicuously coloured archaebacterial Halobacteriaceae [18,19], but also a wide spec- \ntrum of halophilic/halotolerant eubacterial re- \npresentatives including Proteobacteria mostly of \nthe y-subclass ( Halomonas, Vibrio, Pseudomonas \nspecies), actinomycetes (Actinopolyspora, Nocar- \ndiopsis species) and a whole range of Gram-posi- \ntive rods and cocci (e.g. Bacillus, Micrococcus, \nMarinococcus, Salinicoccus species)[20-22]. Bac- \nteria involved in the sulfur cycle and in the nitro- \ngen cycle have also been reported [23-25]. It \ntherefore seems justified to conclude that the \nhalophilic/halotolerant microbial world is proba- \nbly no less diverse than their fresh-water counter- \npart; in fact, halophily/halotolerance as such does \nnot define a group of phylogenetically related \nmicrobes but has evolved (or remained) in many \ndifferent groups of organisms. \nPhysiological stress response \nMicrobes exposed to a saline environment have \nto cope with a number of specific stress factors, \nfor example ionic strength and ion composition. \nIt is not surprising that the cell membrane form- \ning the primary barrier displays adaptive changes \nin the face of altering salinity, as has been exten- \nsively studied in halophilic Vibrio and Ectothio- \nrhodospira species [26-28]. The major effect of \nincreased salinity on membranc lipid composition \nis a rise in the proportion of anionic lipids (often \nphosphatidylglycerol and/or glycolipids) relative \nto zwitterionic lipids, which has a pronounced \neffect on lipid phase behaviour [29,30]. The other \nunavoidable parameter present in all saline \necosystems is osmotic stress. As water is freely \npermeable across the cytoplasmic membrane, a \nnon-adapted organism exposed to an environ- \nment of low water activity (aw = 0.75 for satu- \nrated NaC1) will rapidly loose water and literally \nget 'pickled', a fact which has been used for \nthousands of years for preserving meat, fish and \nvegetables. Osmotic adaptation of halophilic and \nhalotolerant microorganisms, therefore, demands \nosmotic equilibrium across the membranc and a \ncytoplasm of similar osmotic strength to the sur- \nrounding medium [ 1,5,6,31]. \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/15/2-3/95/616066 by guest on 21 April 2025\n97 \nHalophilic and halotolerant microorganisms \nhave thus developed two basic strategies of os- \nmoadaptation: (i) the halobacterial or KCI type \nand (ii) the compatible-solute or organic-osmolyte \ntype. \nThe first mechanism, which has been discov- \nered in and is typical for members of the \nHalobacteriaceae, achieves osmotic equilibrium \nby maintaining a cytoplasmic salt concentration \n(KCI) similar to that of the surrounding medium. \nThis strategy requires a considerable number of \nphysiological changes to safeguard all regulatory \nand metabolic functions at high salinity (salt- \nadapted enzymes and cellular components) [32]. \nOrganisms employing the KCI strategy generally \ndisplay a relatively narrow adaptation for a spe- \ncific environment. Well-known representatives of \nthis group are the halobacteria (Archaea), but \nalso eubacterial fermenting and/or acetogenic \nanaerobes ( Haloanaerobium, Hal\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you have provided two separate texts for processing.
