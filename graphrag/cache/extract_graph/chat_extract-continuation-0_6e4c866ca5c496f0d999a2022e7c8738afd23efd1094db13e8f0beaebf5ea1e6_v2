Instead, glycerol gluco- \nsides have been described in the purple bac- \nterium Rhodobacter sulfidophilus [22,49] and a \nnumber of moderately halophilic cyanobacteria \n[10,11]. The occurrence of sugars (mainly sucrose \nand trchalose) as part of the solute 'cocktail' \nseems to be very common in a wide range of \nmicroorganisms. However, they can only partly \nreplace nitrogen-containing compatible solutes \n[58] and rarely exceed a cytoplasmic concentra- \ntion of 500 raM. These less-compatible solutes \nare, therefore, typical for organisms of limited \nsalt tolerance. They may fail to qualify as compat- \nible solutes 'sensu stricto' and a possible role as \nuniversal stress metabolites enabling survival un- \nder adverse conditions has been under discussion \nfor a long time [59,60]. Similarly, a potential role \nof methylated sulfur compounds (thetines) as os- \nmotic solutes has been suspected for a number of \ncyanobacteria, but, under the conditions tested, \ncytoplasmic concentrations stayed relatively low \nand their importance for osmotic equilibrium of \ntruly halophilic species is still under discussion. The same holds true for c~-glutamine, so far only \nreported from moderately halotolerant members \nof the genus Corynebacterium, which due to its \nlow solubility (approx. 300 raM) reaches cytoplas- \nmic concentrations near saturation [53]. The most \nimportant compatible solutes 'sensu stricto' accu- \nmulating to concentrations well above 0.5 M are \nfurther characterized below. \nGlycine betaine \nGlycine betaine is the typical product of pho- \ntotrophic eubacteria, especially of those display- \ning a high salt tolerance [10,11,61,62], and has \nfurther been found as a primary product in \nhalophilic archaebacterial methanogens [54,55]. \nThe ability to synthesize betaine de novo, how- \never, is rare among aerobic heterotrophic eubac- \nteria; of all strains examined only Actinopolyspora \nhalophila is a betaine producer [22]. \nEctoines \nEctoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimi- \ndine carboxylic acid) was first discovered as a \nminor component in the phototrophic sulfur bac- \nterium Ectothiorhodospira halochloris [63]. This \nsolute is without doubt the most abundant os- \nmolyte of aerobic chemoheterotrophic eubacte- \nria, and as much as betaine can be regarded the \ntypical product of halophilic phototrophic bacte- \nria, ectoines are common solutes of aerobic het- \nerotrophic eubacteria [22]. The hydroxy deriva- \ntive, often found as a minor component in Pro- \nteobacteria of the y-subdivision and in Nocardi- \nopsis species, seems to be of greater importance \nin Gram-positive eubacteria [22]. \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/15/2-3/95/616066 by guest on 21 April 2025\n100 \nProline \nAmong prokaryotes, proline was originally \nconsidered the typical solute of halophilic Bacil- \nh¢s species. This view was primarily based on \ninvestigations into Bacillus subtilis and closely \nrelated species [43]. A thorough screening of a \nwhole range of halophilic/halotolerant bacilli and \nrelated species, however, has revealed that the \nmajority of species produce ectoine, either alone \nor in combination with proline and/or acetylated \ndiamino acids [64]. Bacillus subtilis and Planococ- \ncus citreus seem to represent a minority of pro- \nline producers unable to synthesize ectoine. \nTabLe 2 N-acetylated diamino acids \nThe role of N6-acetylornithin as an osmolyte \nwas first shown in one of our own isolates, strain \nM96/12b [65]. This strain belongs to the so-called \nbacillus-related species and, consequently, N6- \nacetylornithine was also detected, at least as a \nminor component, in almost all Bacillus species \nunder investigation including related organisms \nlike Sporosarcina halophila and Planococcus cit- \nreus. The homologous Ne-acetyllysine, originally \nisolated and identified from Sporosarcina halo- \nphila (Severin & Galinski, unpublished), is also \nfound in Planococcus citreus and some bacilli. \nCompatible solutes of Firmicutes (high GC), based on data of Severin et al.
