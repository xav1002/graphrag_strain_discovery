As the second genome of plants, the rhizosphere microbiome plays critical roles in plant\nﬁtness under stress conditions. Many beneﬁcial microbes that help plants cope with salinity stress have\nbeen identiﬁed, highlighting their roles in mitigating salt stress-induced negative effects on plants.However, a comprehensive review of the microbial species that are able to confer plant salt tolerance\nand the underlying mechanisms is still lacking. In this review, we compared the representative fungal\nand bacterial taxa that demonstrate the ability to enhance plant growth in saline soil. We also reviewedthe mechanisms by which rhizosphere microbes enhance plant salt stress tolerance, i.e., by re-establishing ion and osmotic homeostasis, preventing damage to plant cells, and resuming plant growth\nunder salt stress. Finally, future research efforts to explore the rhizosphere microbiome for agricultural\nsustainability are proposed.\n/C2112022 The Author(s).
