Meckenheimer AUee 168, 53115 Bomz, FRG \nAbstract.\" Salt stress is primarily osmotic stress, and halophilic/halotolerant microorganisms have evolved two basic mcchanisms of \nosmoadaplation: the K('l-type and the compatible-solute type, the latter representing a very flexible mode of adaptation making \nuse of distinct stabilizing properties of compatible solutes. A comprehensive survey, using HPLC and NMR methods, has revealed \nlhc full diversity of eubacterial compatible solutes found in nature. With the exception of proline (a proteinogenic amino acid) they \narc characterized as amino acid derivatives of the following types: bctaines, ectoines, N-acetylated diamino acids and N-derivatized \ncarboxamides of glutamine. From our present knowledge of biosynthetic pathways it appears that, apart from glycine betaine, all \nnitrogen-containing compatible solutes originate from two major pathways (the aspartale branch and thc glutamate branch). \nUptakc of compatible solutes from the growth medium (environment) seems to have preference over de novo synthesis. Therefl)re, \nm the natural ecosystem the solutes of primaw producers (mainly glycine betaine), which are readily excreted upon dilution stress, \ncertainly play an important role as a 'preferred\" solute source for hctcrolrophic organisms, and as a 'vital' source for organisms \nunable to synlhesize their own compatible solutes. \nKey words'.

Concen- \ntrated salt solutions (brines) are found in natural \necosystems like marine ponds and salt marshes \nsnbject to evaporation, salt or soda lakes or in \nman-made forms like salterns or salt works [1]. \nApart from those macrosystems, a variety of less \nconspicuous saline environments provide an addi- \n* Corresponding author.

The chemical \ncomposition of brines originated from sea water \n(thalassohaline) is relatively uniform and charac- \nterized by NaCI as its major solute. However, \nlandlocked lakes of different origin (athalassoha- \nline lakes) may vary widely in their chemical \ncomposition, the most common types being alka- \nline soda lakes (low in magnesium and calcium) \nand magnesium-rich saline bodies like the Dead \nSea (Ca/Mg/NaCl-lake), which has severe con- \nsequences for their microflora [1,5]. Apart from \nthose present-day macrosystems, the geological \nrecord in various parts of the world shows quite \nclearly that hypersaline waters once covered huge \nareas (cf. large deposits of rock salt in Europe \nand North America), providing ample time for \nthe evolution of halophilic/halotolerant forms of \nlife. Organisms thriving at elevated salt concen- \ntrations arc classified as cither (slightly, moder- \nately, extremely) halophilic or just as marine and \nhalotolerant, depending on their growth opti- \nmum. Much attention has been paid to the proper \ndefinition of these terms [6-8] and it is not our \nintention to add to the confusion.
