The second most domi-\nnant phylum was Firmicutes in six sludge samples. Moreover, the re-\nlative abundance of these two phyla was over 98%, and the Proteo-\nbacteria maintained over 80% abundance in all sludge samples. In\naddition, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased at 0– 6% sali-\nnity and decreased at 6– 9% salinity, but the relative abundance of\nProteobacteria appeared the opposite trend compared with the abun-\ndance of Firmicutes . The results showed that Proteobacteria had a wider\nrange of salinity (0 –9%) compared with the Firmicutes (0–6%) ac-\ncording to its high relative abundance of phylum taxa level in di ﬀerent\nsalinity. It was noteworthy that the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes\nwere always detected in some adverse environmental conditions ( Li\net al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016 ). For example, the phyla Proteobacteria\nand Firmicutes were detected and dominant in all antibiotic containingwater samples ( Li et al., 2011 ).Proteobacteria was also found to dom-\ninate in saline wastewater, and presented the increasing trend frominitial 33.4% to 79.6% and 85.1% when salt concentrations increased\nfrom 0 to 50 g L\n−1(Zhang et al., 2016 ).\nThe taxonomic analysis at the class level was summarized at Fig. 4b.\nThe six main classes were detected in all samples, including Gamma-\nproteobacteria ,Bacilli ,Alphaproteobacteria ,Clostridia, Epsilonproteo-\nbacteria and Actinobacteria respectively. Notably, the Gammaproteo-\nbacteria had the highest abundance in class level and was always\ndominant at di ﬀerent salt stages. In addition, the Bacilli accumulated at\n0–6% salinity and its highest abundance was 12.3% at 6% salinity, after\nthat, the abundance of Bacilli decreased from 9.1% to 6.2% with the\nsalinity increased from 8% to 9%. It was worth noting that Epsilonpro-\nteobacteria was 2.27% abundance at 0% salinity, while it was un-\ndetected at 3% salinity. The abundance of Alphaproteobacteria increased\nto 5.4% at 6% salinity and decreased sharply at 8 –9% salinity. It may\nindicate that Bacilli and Alphaproteobacteria could tolerate salinity in\nsome extent, when salinity increased more than the tolerance limit of\nthese classes, the microbe may be weakened or be washed out from the\nSBR system, which was corresponding with the variation of community\ndiversity ( Table 2).
