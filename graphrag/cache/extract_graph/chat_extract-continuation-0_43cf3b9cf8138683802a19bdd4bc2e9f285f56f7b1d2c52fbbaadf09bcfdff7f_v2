Bacillus spp.\nBacillus spp. are gram-positive spore-forming bacteria from the\nphylum Firmicutes and represent the most widely used and well-\nstudied bacteria in agricultural production. Most of the Bacillus\nstrains that are beneﬁcial to plants belong to the subtilis subgroup.\nThese bacteria are generally root surface colonizers or root endo-\nphytes that exert diverse plant beneﬁcial functions. Bacillus spp.\nhave been reported to induce salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (up to\n250 mM NaCl) [57,58] ,maize (up to 100 mM NaCl) [59],barley\n(up to 200 mM NaCl) [60],rice(up to 200 mM NaCl) [61], wheat\n(up to 400 mM NaCl) [62], tomato (up to 300 mM NaCl) [63], chick-\npea (2 % NaCl) [64], cotton (up to 200 mM NaCl) [65], soybean (up\nto 240 mM NaCl) [66] and some halophytes ( Table S1 ).Bacillus can\ntolerate high salt concentrations and form stress-tolerant spores\nwhen exposed to adverse environments [55]. The feature of spore\nformation greatly increases bacterial survival in soil.\n2.6. Pseudomonas spp.\nPseudomonas spp. are gram-negative bacteria from the phylum\nProteobacteria and represent one of the most abundant rhizobacte-\nrial groups. The species enhancing plant salt tolerance include P.\nputida, P. simiae, P. syringae, P. ﬂuorescens, P. migulae, P. thivervalen-\nsis, P. geniculate, P. corrugate, P. stutzeri, P. chlororaphis, P. extremori-\nentalis, P. extremorientalis, P. aurantiaca and P. chlororaphis .\nArabidopsis (up to 200 mM NaCl) [67],maize (up to 150 mM NaCl)\n[68],wheat (up to 200 mM NaCl) [69],cotton (0.35 % NaCl) [70],cu-\ncumber (100 mM NaCl) [71],peanut (100 mM NaCl) [72],soybean\n(100 mM NaCl) [73,74] ,tomato (up to 185 mM NaCl) [75],sun-\nﬂower (EC up to 15.9 dS/m) [76],oats and barley (EC up to 9.4 dS/\nm)[77] have shown elevated growth under salt stress upon inocu-\nlation with Pseudomonas spp. ( Table S1 ).Pseudomonas is a naturally\nhighly abundant bacterial group in the rhizosphere, suggesting\nthat Pseudomonas is adapted to the rhizosphere and may perform\nwell in colonizing roots and thus enhancing plant salt tolerance.\nHowever, as nonspore-forming bacteria, the relatively low survival\nrate of microbial fertilizers or microbial agents during the process\nof production and storage may be disadvantageous for their appli-\ncation in agriculture.3. Mechanisms by which microbes enhance plant salt tolerance\nHigh salinity is a complex type of stress for plants. On the one\nhand, high amounts of Na+and Cl/C0in the cytoplasm (mainly\nNa+) are directly toxic to cells, as they interfere with many protein\nfunctions, thus inﬂuencing cell physiology [2,16] . On the other\nhand, high salt concentrations in soil lead to hyperosmotic stress\nin plant cells and subsequent difﬁculty in acquiring water and soil\nnutrients [2,16] . Both direct ion stress and osmotic stress can be\nsensed immediately after plants are exposed to high-salinity con-\nditions. After perceiving the primary signal, secondary signals, suchas Ca\n2+, ROS and ABA, are generated to induce stress-responsive\ngenes [18]. However, if ROS accumulate, the cells are damaged,\nand programmed cell death is initiated. ABA accumulation induces\nstomatal closure to reduce transpiration, which also reduces water\nuse efﬁciency (WUE) and CO 2use efﬁciency (CUE). To counter the\nnegative effects of Na+and ROS causing cell damage and reducing\nWUE and CUE, plants must produce more ROS-scavenging\nenzymes, transport Na+into vacuoles, and produce osmolytes,\nwhich are costly with regard to energy, thereby leading to growth\ninhibition [1,13,17,18] .\nThe NaCl tolerance of microbes far exceeds the salt tolerance of\nplants. Microbes can concentrate compatible solutes to protect\nagainst the osmotic imbalance between the cytoplasm and the\nenvironment and express diverse Na+transporters to reduce cyto-\nplasmic Na+concentrations. In addition to tolerating high salinity,\nmany fungal and bacterial strains can enhance plant tolerance to\nsalinity and mitigate the salt stress-induced inhibition of plant\ngrowth. Resuming growth under stress conditions is risky because\ngrowth inhibition by stress physiology is actually an energy trade-\noff with tolerance [16]. Nevertheless, microbes have multiple\neffects on plant ion and osmotic balance, ROS regulation and\ndetoxiﬁcation, and photosynthesis. These processes are interre-\nlated and ultimately promote plant growth under salt stress\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the input text is a scientific article about the effects of microbes on plant salt tolerance.
