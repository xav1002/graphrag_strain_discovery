Our isolates Exiguobacterium  sp.GSD1 showed extracellular enzyme \nproduction of protease, lipase and amylase on N-aga r plate with additional food material respectively casein, mineral \noil and starch. Plate results reveal that enzyme se cretion was decreased with increase in salt concent ration with 4% \nand 8% NaCl in comparison to 0% NaCl, this observat ion was made on the basis of zone of enzyme product ion. In \nview of this we can assume that enzymes would be se creting in extracellular environment but because of  high salt \nconcentration in medium, enzymes could not be activ e fully or decrease in growth of microorganism dire ctly affects \nthe production of extracellular enzymes. From the o bservation on production of enzyme, we can deduce t hat as salt \nconcentration increases, it decreases the activity of enzyme, but high salt concentration could not in hibit the enzyme \nactivity completely. These results are in hope and favor to develop and upgrade strategies for enzyme production \nsustainable in high saline medium. Report on Exiguobacterium  255-15 isolated from Siberian permafrost  showed \npotential stress responses with changing growth rat e, cellular morphology, cell membrane composition, \npolysaccharide composition, and carbon utilization under different temperature conditions and wide ran ge of salt \nconcentration makes Exiguobacterium  dynamic organism to survive and study for evolutio nary linkages[32]. \n \nOur isolated Serratia sp. GSD2showed growth upto 10% NaCl in growth medi um, with supporting results same on \nagar plate at 10% NaCl. Previously, Serratia species has been isolated from water, soil, skin o f animals (including \nman) and from the surfaces of plants. Serratia sp.  grows at temperature range from 5–40° and pH range  from 5 to \n9[33,34]. Strains of this species produce plant-gro wth-promoting chemicals, have anti-fungal and anti parasitic \nproperties, encourage the establishment of nitrogen -fixing symbionts and act as insect pathogens [35-3 8]. These \nobservations revealed that in future if any agricul tural soil area covered with saline environment by any natural \ndisaster, our isolated Serratia sp. will be a natural remedy for removal of NaCl t o keep agricultural soil fertile. A \nsubspecies of Serratia marcescens  (S. marcescens  subsp. sakuensis ) and a urea-dissolving species ( Serratia \nureilytica ) have been described previously [39-40]. In our is olated Serratia sp.GSD2 species, we have found biofilm \nproduction[41], which increase with increase in sal t concentration from 0 % to 10 % NaCl salt concentr ation. In this \npresent experiment Serratia sp. GSD2 also produces extracellular enzymes amyla se, protease and lipase. We have \nfound decrease in extracellular enzyme activity as increase in salt concentration ranging from 0%, 4%,  8% NaCl. \n \nProtein content in terms of total gene expression w as increased with increase in salt concentration as  shown in \nExiguobacterium  sp. GSD1  & Serratia sp. GSD2, as well as gradual decline in extracellul ar enzyme activity was \nalso observed in proteinase, lipase and amylase upt o 8% NaCl in solid medium.  Biochemical and biophys ical data \nhave been postulated for several salt-tolerant enzy mes, including glutaminase from Lactobacillus rhamnosus [42] α-\namylase from Bacillus dipsosauri [43], protease from Aspergillus  sp. FC-10[44], α-type carbonic anhydrase from \nDunaliella Salina [45]and thermolysin from B. thermoproteolyticus [46], Lipase from Pichia anamola [47]. \nHalophilic and halotolerant microorganisms have var ious mechanisms to adapt against high salt concentr ation i.e. \nsynthesis of betaine, Ectoine and hydroxyectoine, β-Glutamate, trehalose etc.[48,49], any of or all of  these \nmechanism would be followed in our isolated microoo rganisms under high salt media. Diminished extracel lular \nenzyme activity on increase in salt concentration i n our experiments are in support that halophilic en zymes are found \nto have multilayered hydration shells that are of c onsiderably of greater size and order compared to n on-halophilic \nenzymes[50]. \n \nIn conclusion, this study provides the futuristic a spect of agricultural soil microorganisms on adapta tion and use as a \nnatural fertilizer, whenever any nature disaster li ke tsunami strikes the coastal region of Saurashtra  (Gujarat). The \nabove studied microorganism Exiguobacterium and Serratia will able to survive in high salt condition and co uld be \nthe possible factor to revive fertility of agricult ural soil and removal of salt contamination. Furthe r, extracellular \nenzyme production by Exiguobacterium  and Serratia opens the doors for its application in food, pharm a and \nbioenergy industries.
