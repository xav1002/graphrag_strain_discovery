Salt tolerant microbes can adap t to these saline conditions and\ndegrade the organics in saline wastewater.\nResults: Four salt tolerant bacterial strains isolated  from marine and tannery saline wastewater\nsamples were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus flexus, Exiguobacterium homiense and\nStaphylococcus aureus . Growth factors of the identified st rains were optimized. Tannery saline\nwastewater obtained from a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) near Chennai (southern\nIndia) was treated with pure and mixed consortia of fo ur salt tolerant bacterial strains. Experiments\nwith optimized conditions and varying salt conten t (between 2 and 10% (w/v) were conducted. Salt\ninhibition effects on COD remova l rate were noted. Comparative analysis was made by treating\nthe tannery saline wastewater with  activated sludge obtained from  CETP and with natural habitat\nmicrobes present in raw tannery saline wastewater.\nConclusion: Salt tolerant bacterial mixe d consortia showed appreciable biodegradation at all\nsaline concentrations (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% w/v) with 80% COD reduction in particular at 8%\nsalinity level the consortia could be used as suitable working cu ltures for tannery saline wastewater\ntreatment.\nBackground\nTannery saline wastewater, a primary effluent stream in\nleather processing industry is generated by soaking the\nsalt-laden hides and skins in fresh water to remove excess\nsalt. The presence of high salinity (1â€“10% NaCl by wt) in\nthis waste stream hinders treatment by biological means\n[1]. A biomass sludge adapting to varying saline concen-\ntrations (salt tolerant strains) is required to degrade thedissolved organics present in tannery saline wastewater.\nSeveral groups have made significant contribution to bio-\nlogical treatment of saline wastewater [2-6]. Kargi and\nDincer treated waste waters rich in halogenated organics\nat different salt concentrations and showed COD removal\ndecreased with increasing salt concentration [7]. Woolard\nand Irvine studied the treatment of hypersaline wastewa-\nter by a moderate halophile in a sequencing batch reactorPublished: 29 April 2008\nMicrobial Cell Factories  2008, 7:15 doi:10.1186/1475-2859-7-15Received: 6 February 2008\nAccepted: 29 April 2008\nThis article is available from: http://www. microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/15\nÂ© 2008 Sivaprakasam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons. org/licenses/by/2.0 ), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the orig inal work is properly cited.Microbial Cell Factories  2008, 7:15 http://www.microbialcellfa ctories.com/content/7/1/15\nPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)and in a biofilm reactor [8,9]. Up to 99% phenol removal\nwas obtained from a 15% saline wastewater. Again Kargi\nand Dincer [10] employed Zooglea ramigera to study salt\ninhibition on COD removal in synthetic wastewater in anaerobic fed-batch reactor and further used a halophilicculture, Halobacter halobium to overcome the problem of\nplasmolysis and study the performance of biological treat-\nment under high salt concentration [11].\nMajor problems encountered in biological treatment of\nsaline wastewaters were (i) a limited extent of adaptation,as conventional cultures could not be effectively used totreat saline wastewaters of values higher than 3â€“5% (w/v)\nsalt. (ii) salt adaptations of cultures were easily lost when\nsubjected to salt-free medium. (iii) changes in ionicstrength cell disruptions due to shifts in salt concentra-tion, from 0.5 to 2% (w/v), caused significant reductionsin system performance [12]. (Even with acclimatized cul-tures, satisfactory performance required a constant ioniccomposition). (iv) rapid changes in salt concentrations\ncreated adverse effects more than gradual changes. Nor-\nmalization to constant salt concentration is essentialbefore saline wastewaters\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7e04c7e38aa1c71ce921dfb9f8024e2f80a99fadc5c97bbbcc879835c719608d_v2"}
