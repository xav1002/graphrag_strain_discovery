The salt tolerance of the \nthree mutants is 1.2 times higher than that of the wild \ntype. Multiple substitutions of these amino acid resi -\ndues may alter the ratio of negative to positive charges \non the protease surface, thereby increasing the hydra -\ntion and solubility of the protease surface at high salt \nconcentrations, and improving the salt adaptation of \nthe enzyme itself. Similar studies have also reported \nthat seven amino acid residues of thermophilic pro -\nteases are mutagenized into aspartic acid residues by \nsite-directed mutagenesis to introduce a high frac -\ntion of negative charges on the protein surface (Tak -\nita et al. 2008). The casein hydrolytic activity of six of \nthe seven mutants is 17–19 times higher than that of \nthe wild type when exposed to 4 M NaCl. In addition, \ndirected evolution of random mutagenesis or rational \ndesign of site-directed mutagenesis has been employed \nto improve the thermal stability of proteases (Ashraf \net al. 2019; Martinez et al. 2013; Zhao and Feng 2018). \nThese results suggest that computer-aided design tech -\nniques can be employed to analyze and predict the \namino acid sequence and structural information of \nproteins, enabling rational modification of protease \nmolecules. These modern biotechnological methods Page 16 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \ncan significantly improve the salt tolerance of STPs, \nthus providing a more reliable and efficient source of \nenzymes for industrial applications of STPs.\nExamples of microbial‑derived STPs applied \nto high‑salt traditional soy‑fermented foods\nApplication in soy sauce fermentation\nSoy sauce is one of the most popular and important con -\ndiments in East Asian cuisine, especially in China and \nJapan (Liu et  al. 2015). In general, there are two main \nsteps in the brewing process of soy sauce, namely, koji \nmaking and moromi fermentation (Hu et al. 2020b). The \npurpose of koji-making is to enrich certain enzyme-pro -\nducing microorganisms to obtain a variety of enzymes \n(Zhang et  al. 2022b). The quality of koji determines the \nfermentation efficiency and quality of the soy sauce. The \npurpose of moromi fermentation is to form a specific \nflavor of soy sauce and produce fresh flavor ingredients \n(Wei et al. 2013). A. oryzae, which has a strong ability to \ndigest soybean protein, is an important filamentous fun -\ngus in the process of making koji in soy sauce (Liang et al. \n2009), while Lactobacillus plantarum and yeast are used \nas inoculants in the process of moromi fermentation \n(Singracha et  al. 2017). A. oryzae is rich in alkaline and \nneutral proteases, but less active in acid proteases (Gao \net al. 2010). Given that the brewing process of soy sauce \nis a low pH and high salt system, the alkaline proteases in \nA. oryzae gradually lose their activity under acidic con -\nditions, so neutral proteases dominate in this phase (Hu \net  al. 2020b). In general, most extracellular proteases of \nA. oryzae are salt-intolerant and are rapidly inactivated \nduring the first few days of moromi fermentation, result -\ning in a decrease in raw material utilization and flavor \ncontent of soy sauce (Gao et al. 2020).\nVarious strategies have been used to improve the ability \nof Aspergillus  to produce STPs in soy sauce production. \nThrough  N+ ion implantation mutagenesis, a mutated \nstrain A100-8 of A. oryzae 3.042 with improved protease \nproduction has been derived, exhibiting an approxi -\nmately 44.1% increase in salt-tolerant acid protease \nactivity (Zhao et al. 2012). A. oryzae 3.042 has also been \nmodified using atmospheric pressure and room tempera -\nture plasma techniques (Gao et  al. 2020). The obtained \nmutant H8 has high STP activity and is able to signifi -\ncantly increase the amount of peptides and free amino \nacids in soy sauce. Similarly, the expression of several key \nhydrolase genes from Aspergillus sojae or A. oryzae, such \nas protease, peptidase, and glutaminase, in the salt-tol -\nerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii not only increases \nthe yield of STPs, but also serves as a potential means to \nprovide additional hydrolase during soy sauce fermenta -\ntion (Yuzuki et al. 2015).In addition to genetic modification, exogenous addition \nof STPs has been shown to be effective in improving pro -\ntein utilization in soy sauce brewing ingredients and soy \nsauce fermentation quality (Chen et  al. 2023). Previous \nstudies have reported the purification of various STPs \nfrom A. oryzae, including salt-tolerant acid protease (Lee \net  al. 2010), salt-tolerant neutral protease (Wang et\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_735f4563a1885719d4b794af139cde77317b699fc71f18e77ff358e3bc8a9fbe_v2"}
