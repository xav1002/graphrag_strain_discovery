These osmosensing signal and DNA supercoiling could\ninitiate uptake of the osmolyte glycine betaine, proline ( Csonka,\n1989) or initiates the expression of genetic elements required tocope with osmotic stress ( Higgins et al., 1988 ). This could be\nthe possible mechanism by which putative STK_PknB of pSSR6\nmightbeextendingosmotolerancetothehost E.coli.\nThepSSR21 ORF2 encodes a protein sharing homology\nwith a hypothetical protein of Candidatus Handelsmanbacteria\npossessing a conserved domain for DUF3445 superfamily,\ni.e., an uncharacterized protein family having conserved RLP\nsequencemotif( Batemanetal.,2010 ).However,itsphysiological\ncharacterization and intracellular ion concentration anal ysis\nindicates that it extends host osmotolerance property by\nmaintaining low intracellular ion concentration even in th e\npresenceofanionicstressor.However,adetailedmechanism still\nneedstobeelucidated.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this study, the functional metagenomic approach was\nused to decipher salt stress tolerant genes in the saline soil\nmicrobiome.
