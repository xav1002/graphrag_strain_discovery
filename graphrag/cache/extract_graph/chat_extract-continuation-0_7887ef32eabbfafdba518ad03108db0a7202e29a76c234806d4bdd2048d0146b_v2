Salt-tolerant proteases (STPs) from microorganisms exhibit higher salt toler -\nance, wider adaptability, and more efficient catalytic ability under extreme conditions compared to conventional \nproteases. These unique enzymes hold great promise for applications in various industries including food, medicine, \nenvironmental protection, agriculture, detergents, dyes, and others. Scientific studies on microbial-derived STPs \nhave been widely reported, but there has been little systematic review of microbial-derived STPs and their applica-\ntion in high-salt conventional soybean fermentable foods. This review presents the STP-producing microbial species \nand their selection methods, and summarizes and analyzes the salt tolerance mechanisms of the microorganisms. It \nalso outlines various techniques for the isolation and purification of STPs from microorganisms and discusses the salt \ntolerance mechanisms of STPs. Furthermore, this review demonstrates the contribution of modern biotechnology \nin the screening of novel microbial-derived STPs and their improvement in salt tolerance. It highlights the potential \napplications and commercial value of salt-tolerant microorganisms and STPs in high-salt traditional soy fermented \nfoods. The review ends with concluding remarks on the challenges and future directions for microbial-derived STPs. \nThis review provides valuable insights into the separation, purification, performance enhancement, and application \nof microbial-derived STPs in traditional fermented foods.\nKeywords  Application, Mechanism, Microorganism, Modern biotechnology, Salt tolerance, Salt-tolerant protease, \nSoy fermentable foods\n†Hongli Yao and Shuangping Liu contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence:\nJian Mao\nmaojian@jiangnan.edu.cn\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlePage 2 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \nGraphical Abstract\nIntroduction\nProteases are a class of enzymes that hydrolyze pro -\nteins, breaking them down into smaller peptides and \namino acids (Aguilar and Sato 2018; Razzaq et al. 2019). \nDepending on the peptide bond hydrolyzed, proteases \ncan be divided into exopeptidases, which cleave the N- \nor C-terminal peptide bond, and endopeptidases, which \ncleave the internal peptide bond (Boon et al. 2020; Mat -\nkawala et  al. 2021). Depending on the optimal pH for \ntheir action, they can be classified as alkaline, acidic, or \nneutral proteases (Matkawala et  al. 2021). Additionally, \nthey can be divided into serine proteases, sulfhydryl pro -\nteases, metalloproteases, and acid proteases, according \nto the group in which they exert their hydrolytic action \n(Matkawala et  al. 2021). Remarkably, certain proteases \ndemonstrate high selectivity by selectively hydrolyz -\ning specific peptide bonds in protein substrates. Micro -\norganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and archaea, have \nthe ability to secrete various types of proteases (Agui -\nlar and Sato 2018; Razzaq et al. 2019). For example, the \nbacterium Bacillus cereus is known to secrete alkaline \nproteases (Orhan et  al. 2005), while the fungus Asper -\ngillus niger is capable of secreting acidic proteases (Wei \net  al. 2023). These microbial-derived proteases possess \nadvantageous characteristics, including high efficiency, \nstability, and ease of purification. Consequently, they are \nwidely employed in various industries such as food, feed, pharmaceutical, and leather processing (Chanalia et  al. \n2011; Matkawala et al\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the output is a scientific article about microbial-derived salt-tolerant proteases and their applications in high-salt traditional soybean fermented foods.
