The salt concentrations werevaried from 2–10% (w/v) and a good biodegradability oftannery saline wastewater was observed with salt tolerantbacterial mixed consortia (80% COD reduction in 8%\nsalinity). Increase in salt concentration to 10% resulted in\ndeterioration of the treatment process and poor CODreduction (60% for mixed consortia). This study sug-gested the possibility of successful application of identi-fied salt tolerant bacterial consortia for efficientdegradation of tannery saline wastewater. Such applica-\ntion would compare well with other conventional biolog-\nical treatment processes being used with activated sludgeas a working culture.\nAuthors' contributions\nSS carried out the tannery wastewater biodegradationstudies and drafted the manuscript. MS guided this work,\nanalyzed the results and made technical correction of the\nmanuscript. SS carried out the bacterial isolation, bio-chemical assays and COD estimation. SR participated inthe design of experiments. All authors read and approvedthe final manuscript.\nAdditional materialAcknowledgements\nOne of the authors Dr. S Senthilkumar is grateful to the Council of Scien-\ntific & Industrial Research, New Delh i, for a Senior Rese arch Fellowship. \nThanks are due to the Director, Centra l Leather Research Institute, Chen-\nnai, for permission to communicate this paper.\nThe authors also express their gratit ude to Prof K.Gandhi and Prof. NR \nRajagopal for useful suggestions and constant encouragement.\nReferences\n1.
