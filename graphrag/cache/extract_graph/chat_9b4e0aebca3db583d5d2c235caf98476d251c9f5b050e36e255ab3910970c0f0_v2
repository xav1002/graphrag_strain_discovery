Several systems for maintaining  K+ \nhomeostasis in cells have been reported. These systems, \nwhich maintain cell stability, play different roles in differ -\nent media and transport processes of  K+ concentration \n(Lefebvre and Moletta 2006).\nThe accumulation of compatible solutes is one of the \nmost common salt tolerance mechanisms of microorgan -\nisms. In response to a high salt environment, microorgan -\nisms accumulate intracellular small molecule substances \nthrough intracellular synthesis or direct acquisition from \nthe surrounding media to maintain cellular osmotic equi -\nlibrium. These substances are highly water-soluble mol -\necules, known as ’compatible solutes’ , including glycerol, \nsugars, polyols, betaine, ectoine, hydroxyectoine, proline, \nlysine, and glycine (Zhang et al. 2022d). Different micro -\norganisms may use one or more different compatible \nsolutes. The salt stress of marine myxobacteria, Plesio -\ncystis pacifica SIR-1 and Enhygromyxa salina SWB007, \nshows that the former only depends on the accumula -\ntion of amino acids, while the latter uses hydroxyectoine \nas the main compatible solute in addition to betaine \n(Moghaddam et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2022d). The genetic \ncode also confirms that only the latter has the biosynthe -\nsis capacity of betaine, ectoine, and hydroxyectoine. In \naddition, microorganisms using the intracellular small \nmolecule compatible solute accumulation strategy are generally more flexible and can more easily adapt to pres -\nsure or salinity-induced mutation than those that use a \nsalt solution strategy (Kurt-Kizildogan et al. 2017). There \nmay be different mechanisms of salt tolerance between \nhalophilic and halotolerant microorganisms. Researchers \nhave discovered that strict halophilic bacteria employ the \nsalt-in and accumulation of compatible solutes strategies \nfor osmoregulation under high salt conditions. In con -\ntrast, halotolerant bacteria utilize the compatible solute \naccumulation strategy rather than the salt-in strategy to \nresist salt stress (Vaidya et al. 2018).\nStudy on microbial‑derived STPs\nIsolation and purification of STPs\nSeparation and purification of STPs is a complex pro -\ncess. After obtaining suitable enzyme-producing condi -\ntions and selecting suitable separation and purification \nmethods, microbial cells need to be cultured to obtain \nlarge quantities of the enzyme. Some information on the \npurification and separation of microbial-derived STPs \nand their enzymatic properties is collected in Table  2. \nThe steps involved in the isolation and purification of \nproteases are slightly different due to the different posi -\ntions of proteases in the cell. For intracellular proteases, \nmicrobial cells need to be physically or chemically bro -\nken down to release intracellular proteases. Using the \nabove method, a large number of crude enzymes have \nbeen obtained (Hou et  al. 2019). For extracellular pro -\nteases, culture media are usually collected directly and \ncrude enzyme solutions are obtained by concentration \nand centrifugation (Tanasupawat et al. 2011). Salting-out, \ndialysis, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration \nchromatography are often used to enrich and purify pro -\nteases. The neutral protease with high salt tolerance from \nA. oryzae CICIM F0899 has been purified by ammonium \nsulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and \ngel filtration chromatography (Wang et  al. 2013). The \ntotal recovery of the enzyme is 2%, and the optimum pH \nvalue and temperature are 7.0–9.0 and 50  °C, respec -\ntively. The protease shows high salt tolerance in 18% \nNaCl, maintaining 72% of its initial activity after 14 days. \nSimilarly, a salt-tolerant alkaline protease has been iso -\nlated and purified from the culture medium of A. ory -\nzae 3.042 by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, \nand gel filtration chromatography (Gao et al. 2019). The \noptimum pH and temperature of the enzyme are 9.0 and \n40 °C, respectively. After incubation with 3.0 M NaCl for \n7 days, the relative enzyme activity remained above 20%. \nThe same method has been used for the separation and \npurification of the proteases produced by microorgan -\nisms in certain special habitats, such as the ocean, salt \nfarms, and saline-alkali soils. Halophilic neutral proteases \nfrom H. agarilyticus GUGFAWS-3 have been isolated and Page 10 of 23 Yao et al.
