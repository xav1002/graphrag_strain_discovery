Groups marked as such do not necessarily\nconsist solely of halophiles. The opposite is true: there are\nonly a few phylogenetically consistent groups that are\ncomposed entirely of halophiles (see below). In most\ncases halophiles and non-halophilic relatives are found\ntogether in the phylogenetic tree, and many genera, fami-\nlies and orders have representatives with greatly different\nsalt requirement and tolerance. Within the Archaea we\nfind the most salt-requiring microorganisms in the order\nHalobacteriales , which contains a single family, the Halo-\nbacteriaceae . Halobacterium and most of its relatives require\nover 100â€“150 g/l salt for growth and structural stability.\nAlso within the class Methanothermea (Methanococci ),\norder Methanosarcinales we encounter halophilic or highly\nhalotolerant representatives (genera Methanohalophilus ,\nMethanohalobium ). All these belong to the phylum Euryar-\nchaeota ; no halophilic representatives have yet been iden-\ntified within the Crenarchaeota . Halophily is widespread\nin the bacterial kingdom: we know halophiles within the\nphyla Cyanobacteria , Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacte-\nria, Spirochaetes , and Bacteroidetes .\nWith a few notable exceptions, the eukaryotic microor-\nganisms form a sadly neglected group as far as the study of\ntheir distribution in high-salt environments and their\nphysiological adaptation to life at high salt concentrationsis concerned. The unicellular green algae of the genus\nDunaliella have been investigated in-depth, as they are the\nmain or sole primary producers in many hypersaline envi-\nronments, they have become a popular model system for\nthe study of salt adaptation by using organic osmotic\n'compatible' solutes, and they have also found biotechno-\nlogical applications [7]. The occurrence of the brine\nshrimp ( Artemia salina , Artemia franciscana ) in salt lakes is\nalso well known, but the discussion of its biology is out-\nside the scope of this review. The Fungi, long neglected in\nhalophile research, contain a number of representatives\nthat by all criteria are true halophiles, both by their abso-\nlute requirement for high salt and by their ability to grow\nup to salt concentrations approaching saturation. Exam-\nples are the meristematic fungus Trimmatostroma salinum\n[8] and the black yeast Hortaea werneckii [9], organisms\nindigenous to saltern brines and other hypersaline envi-\nronments. Even more severely neglected is the study of\nflagellate, ciliate and amoeboid protozoa that live in high-\nsalt environments. The existence of such organisms has\nbeen documented already long ago [[10,11]; for an over-\nview of the early literature see [12]), but only recently has\nthe study of truly halophilic heterotrophic nanoflagellates\ntaken off. Different types of halophilic flagellates were\nfound in Korean saltern ponds [13], and two species have\nthus far been characterized in-depth. The first is Pleurosto-The universal phylogenetic tree of life as based on small subunit rRNA gene sequences , and the distribution of halophilic micro - organisms within the treeFigure 1\nThe universal phylogenetic tree of life as based on small subunit rRNA gene sequences, and the distribution of \nhalophilic microorganisms within the tree.  Groups marked with blue boxes contain at least one halophilic representative \n(e.g the Bacteroidetes , of which Salinibacter ruber is the sole halophilic member descri bed to date); others such as the Halobacte-\nriales consist entirely of halophiles. The tree is base d on Fig. 11.16 in Madigan and Martinko, 2006 (78).\nSaline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 4 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)mum flabellatum , an organism known already since the\n1930s. An isolate from a saltern pond with 313 g/l salt has\nits optimum at 300 g/l salt and does not grow below150â€“200 g/l [14]. Another bacteriovorous heterotrophicnanoflagellate isolated from a 300 g/l saltern pond isHalocafetaria seosinensis , which grows optimally at 150 g/l\nsalt, does not grow below 75 g/l, and tolerates concentra-\ntions above 350 g/l total dissolved salts [15].\nThe Halobacteriales , the Halomonadaceae , and the \nHalanaerobiales : three phylogenetica lly coherent groups \nof halophiles\nWithin the small subunit rRNA gene sequence-based tree\nof life we find three groups of prokaryotes that are both\nphylogenetically and physiologically coherent and consistentirely or almost entirely of halophiles.
