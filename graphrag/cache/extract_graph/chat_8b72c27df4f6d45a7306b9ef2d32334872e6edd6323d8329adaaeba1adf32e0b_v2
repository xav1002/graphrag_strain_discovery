(2) Selection pressure hypothesis\ncould be separated as hydraulic selection pressure and biological se-\nlection pressure, which was widely used to optimize the operation\nparameters of reactor and to explain the formation of aerobic granular\nsludge. In such experiment, one selection pressure was the settling time,\nFig. 4. Analysis of microbial diversity at di ﬀerent taxo-\nnomic level for di ﬀerent salinity samples: phylum (a); class\n(b); genus (c).D. Ou et al. Bioresource Technology 249 (2018) 132–138\n136which was considered as a successful strategy for the rapid start-up of\naerobic granular reactors ( Szabó et al., 2016). Su et al. (2013) also\nsuggested that automatically adjusted of settling time was an optimumcontrolling strategy for granulation process. When settling time con-\ntinuously decreased from 30 min to 3 min, young granules were pushed\nto adhere more focs and ﬂocs were pushed to get together to obtain\nenough weight, so that the lighter ﬂocs were washed out and the en-\nough heavy young granules accumulated in the system. It was worth\nnoting that the other selection pressure was salt concentration, which\ncan be seen not only as hydraulic selection pressure but also as biolo-\ngical selection pressure. As a hydraulic selection pressure, with stepped\nincrease of salt concentration from 0% to 9%, synthetic wastewater\ndensity correspondingly increased, resulting only bigger ﬂocs or young\ngranules could stay in the SBR system, which could be seen as the en-hancement of the function of decreased settling time. Moussa et al.\n(2006) also found that the settling time were chosen to allow only\ngranules to retain, and density played a similar role in systems under\nsalt stress. As a biological selection pressure, elevated salinity pushed\nthe SBR system to alter the microbial community to adapt hypersaline\nstress. Under high salt concentration (> 1 wt% salinity), the increase of\nsalinity resulted in an increase of the halotolerant bacteria, and the\nmicrobial community could express di ﬀerent tolerance levels to such a\nbiological selection pressure of salinity ( Lim et al., 2007). The result of\nsalinity selection pressure was that some adapted bacteria was capableof salt tolerance, while other unadaptable bacteria was granularly wa-\nshed out or weakened with increasing salinity. (3) As described by the\nDLVO theory, the double layer becomes compressed at high ionic\nstrength, reducing the surface potential, but keeping the surface charge\ndensity constant ( Esparza-Soto and Westerho ﬀ, 2003 ). The increase of\nsalt concentration from 0% to 9% resulted in compressing the doublelayers, reducing the total repulsive forces between di ﬀerent zoogleas,\nand improved the mature of young granules. In addition, the combi-nation of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the ﬂocs in-\ncreased the ﬂock size ( Moussa et al., 2006 ).Li et al. (2017) found thatthe addition of seawater signi ﬁcantly accelerated the granulation pro-\ncess compared with freshwater and a salinity-induced decrease in\nelectrostatic charge on the surface of cells allowed sludge ﬂocculation.\nThereby, it was bene ﬁcial for the aggregation of ﬂocs and the ma-\nturation of salt-tolerant granular sludge.\nIn summary, the strong support material of anaerobic granules\nstated the formation process of young granules. With the double se-\nlection pressure of settling time and salinity, young granules gradually\naccumulated in SBR system, and the halophilic microorganisms en-\nriched as the corresponding to the high saline stress. Meanwhile, the\naerobic granular sludge gradually transited from the young stage to\nmature stage with the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic\ninteractions. Finally, the salt-tolerant granular sludge was successfully\ncultivated in response to the hypersaline stress.\n4. Conclusion\nThe salt-tolerance aerobic granular sludge dominated by moderately\nhalophilic genera was successfully cultivated in SBR system, and it\ncould tolerate 9% saline concentration. Crystal nucleus hypothesis,\nselection pressure hypothesis and compressed double electric layers\nhypothesis were used to explain the formation of salt-tolerant granular\nsludge. Notably, salinity contributed a lot to the formation and the\nmicrobial community structure of SAGS, while it declined the perfor-\nmance of SAGS system. Sequence analysis showed halophilic bacteriaobviously increased corresponding to the increased salinity. In detail,\nSalinicola and Halomonas were gradually dominant and considered as\nthe functional groups for the tolerance of hypersaline stress.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was ﬁnancially supported by the National Natural Science\nFoundation\nof China (51578240, 51378208, and 41273109), the\nNational Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFC0206200),\nFig. 5.
