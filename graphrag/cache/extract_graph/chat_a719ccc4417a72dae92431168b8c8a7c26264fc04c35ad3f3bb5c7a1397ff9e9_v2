In ﬂuence of high salinity (0 –9% w/\nv NaCl) on the formation, performance and microbial succession of the SAGS were explored. Crystal nucleus\nhypothesis, selection pressure hypothesis and compressed double electric layers hypothesis were used to discussthe formation mechanism of SAGS. Notably, salinity could be seen as a kind of selection pressure contributed to\nthe formation of SAGS, while salinity also declined the performance of SAGS system. High throughput 16S rRNA\ngene analysis showed that the salinity had great in ﬂuence on the species succession and community structure of\nSAGS. Moreover, Salinicola and Halomonas were dominant at 9% salt concentration, therefore moderate halo-\nphiles were identi ﬁed as functional groups for the tolerance of hypersaline stress.\n1. Introduction\nNowadays salinity is considered as a common stress factor in was-\ntewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially in industrial sectors, such\nas pickling, cheese manufacturing, seafood processing, tanning and\npharmaceuticals ( Moussa et al., 2006 ). Physical-chemical methods were\nconventionally used to treat the saline wastewater, while the cost wasparticularly high. Thus, choosing an alternative technology treating\nsaline wastewater is urgent.\nThe traditional-activated sludge process has been proved to be a\nfeasible, cost-e ﬀective treatment for degradation of organic pollutants\nin saline wastewater, which represents as much as 5% of worldwide\neﬄuent treatment requirements ( Lefebvre et al., 2007). Besides, aerobic\ngranular sludge, a promising biological treatment technology, has re-cently received more attention due to its remarkable settling char-\nacteristics, which can result in high sludge concentration and low re-\nactor space ( Abbas et al., 2015; Adav et al., 2008 ).\nIn recent years, much e ﬀort has been paid to study the e ﬀect of\nsalinity on the performance and microbial community of aerobic\ngranular sludge in SBR system ( Lefebvre et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015;\nZhao et al., 2016). Besides, with the development of sequencing tech-nique, high-throughput sequencing technology has been used to explore\nmicrobial communities under various environmental conditions. For\nexample, high-throughput sequencing was used to study theperformance and microbial community pro ﬁles in a SBR from 0 wt% to\n3.0 wt% salinity, and found that Actinobacteria was dominant at salinity\nhigher than 2.5 wt% ( Zhao et al., 2016 ).Wang et al. (2016) reported\nthat salinity had selective e ﬀects on the microbial community structure,\nand salt-resistant microbes contributed to the rising of richness and\ndiversity at 2% and 4% NaCl stress. Salinity is known to in ﬂuence the\ndegradation rate through the inhibition of microbial activity or enzymeactivity. Besides, with the increase of salinity, the water density cor-\nrespondingly increased, causing the adverse e ﬀect on the settling\ncharacteristics. However, Moussa et al. (2006) reported that gradually\nincrease salinity will stimulate the selection of dense ﬂocs with\nminimum washout, and higher salt contents evolved a better settling\nsludge. Therefore, the hypersaline stress may not only shift the domi-\nnated microbial species, especially for some halotolerant bacteria, but\nalso in ﬂuence the formation process of granular sludge. In addition, the\nforming characteristics of salt-tolerant granular sludge and microbialcommunity succession with elevated salinity were still unclear.\nIn this study, a lab-scale SBR was introduced to explore the per-\nformance, formation and microbial succession of salt-tolerance granular\nsludge respond to hypersaline stress (0 –9% w/v NaCl). The 16S rRNA\ngene high-throughput sequencing was applied to decipher the speciessuccession and community structure of salt-tolerance granular sludge\nand to identify the role of some functional salt-tolerant bacteria in salt-\ntolerance aerobic granular sludge system.
