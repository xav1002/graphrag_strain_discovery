In fact, the fermentation process Page 18 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \nof sufu mainly involves biochemical and physical changes \ninvolving the degradation of proteins, lipids, and sugars \n(Chou and Hwan 1994). It has been shown that these \nchemical changes in the fermentation process of sufu, \nespecially in the ripening process, are affected by sodium \nchloride and ethanol (Han et  al. 2003). The addition of \nalcohol to the brine solution not only preserves but also \nslows down the hydrolysis of proteins during aging (Chou \nand Hwan 1994). These factors contribute to the long \nproduction cycle (usually 3–6 months) of sufu like other \nhigh-salt soy-fermented foods, which limits its industrial \nproduction (Feng et al. 2014; Han et al. 2004).\nIn recent years, there has been a surge in research \nefforts to expedite the production cycle of sufu. Fer -\nmentation with multiple strains rather than a single \nstrain, such as Mucor and Rhizopus hybrid fermentation. \nMucor can secrete abundant STPs and other beneficial \nenzymes, while Rhizopus can produce small amounts \nof ethanol and organic acids, and its growth tempera -\nture is lower than that of Mucor. Therefore, Rhizopus is \nused in the fermentation process of sufu, which breaks \nthe seasonal limitation of sufu production and reduces \nthe amount of ethanol in sufu fermentation (Wang et al. \n2020). The introduction of a mixed starter consisting of \nyeast and lactic acid bacteria has been shown to be ben -\neficial in enhancing sufu fermentation (Xie et  al. 2018). \nThis approach not only increases the activity of salt-\ntolerant enzymes such as protease, lipase, peptidase, \nand α-amylase but also contributes to the enrichment \nof free amino acids and other functional components, \nresulting in sufu with distinct characteristics in terms \nof color, aroma, taste, and functional substances. Tak -\ning advantage of its ability to thrive and its abundance of \nsalt-tolerant enzymes in low-temperature environments, \nAspergillus flavus has been employed in cryogenic fer -\nmentation of sufu, effectively addressing the limitation of \ncommercial sufu production at low temperatures (Cheng \net al. 2009).\nFurthermore, the addition of exogenous salt-tolerant \nenzymes is widely utilized as a convenient approach in \ncommercial applications. This approach enhances the \nenzymatic system of fermenting microorganisms and \ncapitalizes on the synergistic effect between microorgan -\nisms and enzymes. As a result, it not only streamlines the \nproduction process and reduces the production cycle, \nbut also enhances product quality and environmental \nhygiene. Studies have reported that the addition of STP \nas an adjuvant to the fermentation process of Kedong \nsufu (a typical sufu fermented using bacteria) (Feng et al. \n2014). The levels of water-soluble proteins, amino acid \nnitrogen, peptides, total free amino acids, and 11 out of \n17 free amino acids are significantly higher compared to \nthe control group without enzyme addition, indicating that the ripening of sufu can be accelerated and the rip -\nening time of sufu can be shortened by adding STPs. \nSimilarly, accelerated ripening by exogenous proteases \nhas also been demonstrated in cheese (Kilcawley et  al. \n2012). In addition, the use of STPs has been shown to be \neffective in enhancing the flavor and product quality of \nTofu-misozuke (a food inherent to the Fukuoka district \nof Japan is a type of soybean curd fermented in miso) \n(Funaki et  al. 1997). Mold-fermented sufu and enzy -\nmatically ripened sufu (by soaking salted tofu cubes in \nthe prepared koji mash containing various salt-resistant \nhydrolases) are two common processes used in sufu mak -\ning. Studies have reported that the fermentation cycle \nof koji enzyme-ripened sufu typically takes only about \ntwo to three weeks compared to that of mold-fermented \nsufu, which is much shorter than the four to six months \nrequired to prepare mold-fermented sufu (Feng et  al. \n2014; Li et al. 2010). This suggests that the rate of hydrol -\nysis by the addition of salt-resistant enzymes, especially \nSTPs, is higher than that of mold-fermented sufu during \nthe production of sufu.\nConclusion\nDue to their specificity, STPs have gradually been recog -\nnized as promising candidates for applications in various \nfields. The improvement of salt tolerance of proteases \nbased on various modern biotechnologies needs to be \nestablished on the basis of elucidating the mechanism \nof salt tolerance of proteases. However, salt-tolerant \nmechanisms of STPs from different microbial sources \nare unclear.
