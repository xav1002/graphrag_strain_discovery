Analytical methods\nThe conventional indexes of COD, MLSS, mixed liquor volatile\nsuspended solids (MLVSS), and SVI were analyzed according to the\nStandard Methods.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Performance and formation of SAGS\nThe SBR system was operated in three di ﬀerent phases ( Fig. 1 ), and\nthe operational conditions of SBR system were listed in Table 1. The\nperformance in each phase including MLSS, MLVSS, SVI and removal\nrate was described as follows:\nPhase I (start-up): During the phase I, the in ﬂuent COD concentra-\ntion varied from 1000 to 1800 mg L\n−1as the salinity increased from 0%\nto 3%, the system always showed a high COD removal rate of greaterthan 85%. In case of excessive loss of sludge, the system initially\nmaintained the 30 min settling time, so that the MLSS and MLVSS in-\ncreased signi ﬁcantly, and the sludge maintained the ﬂocculent mor-\nphology. When salt concentration gradually increased from 2% to 3%,the settling time decreased from 30 min to 15 min to promote the for-\nmation of granular sludge. Moreover, anaerobic time (20 min) was in-\ntroduced to inhibit the overgrowth of ﬁlamentous bacteria at 2% salt\nconcentration, and with the increase of salinity the anaerobic timeextended to 30 min, which was an e ﬀective way to decrease the dis-\nintegration of aerobic granular sludge ( Long et al., 2014 ). The granular\nsludge emerged on day 32, soon after that MLSS and SVI were found to\nreduce considerably due to the wash out of ﬂoc sludge, which was as-\nsociated to the reduce of settling time and the increase of wastewaterdensity caused by salinity.\nPhase II (acclimation under saline stress): The system was continued\nto operate at 4– 6% saline stress, and the settling time further decreased\nTable 1\nOperating conditions and performance of aerobic granular sludge under di ﬀerent salinities.\nSalinity(% w/v)Time(d)Inﬂuent COD\n(mg L\n−1)Eﬄuent COD\n(mg L−1)Removal rate (%) Setting time\n(min/cycle)Anaerobic time(min/cycle)\n00 –14 1000 40 96 30 0\n11 5 –28 1200 36 97 30 0\n22 9 –42 1400 84 94 15 20\n34 3 –56 1800 216 88 15 20\n45 7 –70 2000 500 75 5 30\n57 1 –84 2200 770 65 5 30\n68 5 –98 2500 1150 54 3 30\n79 9 –112 2500 1175 53 3 30\n8 113 –126 2500 1275 49 3 30\n9 126 –140 2500 1250 50 3 30D.

While the salinity increased\nfrom 5% to 6%, SVI decreased and MLSS increased sharply. With\ncontinuous double pressure of salinity and settling time, the granular\nsludge dominated gradually, which accounted for more than 90% in the\nSBR system. Besides, the COD removal rate decreased from 88% to\n54%. As previous reports ( Yogalakshmi and Joseph, 2010; Zhao et al.,\n2016 ), the increase of salinity inhibited the microbial metabolism,\nthereby reduced the degradation ability of SAGS.\nPhase III (elevated salt concentration): However, the salt stress in-\ncreasing from 7% to 9% salinity had little in ﬂ\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you have provided two separate texts with different topics and formats.
