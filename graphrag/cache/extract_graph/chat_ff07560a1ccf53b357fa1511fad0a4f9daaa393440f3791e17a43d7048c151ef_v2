With the advancement of bioinfor -\nmatics, there has been a growing number of studies on \nintegrated metagenomic approaches such as metagen -\nomics and metaproteomics to assist in the screening of \nSTP-producing microorganisms (Busche et al. 2018; Gar -\ncia-Moyano et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022). Using metagen -\nomics and peptidomics analysis, 138 umami peptides \nand 6 kinds of proteases from 35 microbial genera have \nbeen identified from traditional fish fermentation (Yang \net al. 2022). The role of cellular proteases in Streptomy -\nces protein secretion has been identified by multi-omics \nand targeted approaches, providing the first multi-omics \ntechniques effort to characterize the complex regulatory \nmechanisms of Streptomyces protein secretion (Busche \net al. 2018). Multi-omics techniques can help scientists to \nfully understand the genetic, transcriptional, protein, and \nmetabolic information of microorganisms, thereby aid -\ning microbial breeding and optimization (Aguiar-Pulido \net  al. 2016; Ge et  al. 2021; Wu et  al. 2022). A process \nframework for screening STP-producing microorganisms \nusing multi-omics techniques is shown in Fig.  1. Based Page 7 of 23\n Yao et al.

In summary, the breeding of STP-producing \nmicroorganisms requires the combined use of physi -\ncal, chemical, biological, and information technologies, \nas well as other technological means. In the future, it is \nworth discussing how these techniques can be used to \nquickly, accurately, and efficiently select microorganisms \nproducing STPs.\nSalt‑tolerant mechanisms of microorganisms\nMicroorganisms can adapt to a wide range of NaCl con -\ncentrations, and their NaCl tolerance may be far greater \nthan that of any other organism (Vreeland 1987). Halo -\nphilic/halotolerant microorganisms that are able to \nhydrolyze proteins are an important source of STPs. \nHalophilic/halotolerant microorganisms are well adapted \nto higher salt concentrations, and the enzymes they pro -\nduce must remain active in high-salinity environments \n(Mokashe et al. 2018). Several studies have been reported \non the salt-tolerant mechanisms of microorganisms \n(Chen et  al. 2021; Kurt-Kizildogan et  al. 2017). Halo -\nphilic microorganisms prefer high-salt concentrations to \nsurvive and reproduce compared to halotolerant micro -\norganisms, but this review does not strictly distinguish \nthe salt-tolerant mechanisms between halophilic and \nhalotolerant microorganisms. In general, these microor -\nganisms adapt to different salt concentrations through \nrejection, secretion, and intracellular accumulation, and \nthese processes have been attributed to multiple mech -\nanisms (Edbeib et  al. 2016; Vreeland 1987). Several salt \ntolerance mechanisms for some salt-tolerant bacteria are \nshown in Fig.  2. These salt-tolerant mechanisms are sum -\nmarized below.\nAdaptive strategies employed by microorganisms for \nachieving salt tolerance involve the differential expres -\nsion of gene regulatory proteins. Under the stress of \na highly osmotic environment, these microorganisms \nregulate and orchestrate protein expression by up-regu -\nlating, down-regulating, and replicating pertinent genes. \nSuch proteins include membrane transporters, oxidative \nstress proteins, ferritin, as well as various enzymes, such \nas dehydrogenase, synthase, and salt-tolerant enzymes \n(Chen et al. 2021; Soppa 2006). A transcriptional analy -\nsis of low- and high-salt genes in the extremely halophilic \narchaea Halolalama  sp. YKT1, isolated from a salt mine \nin Turkey, has revealed that 2149 genes are up-regulated \nand 1638 genes are down-regulated under high-salt con -\nditions (Kurt-Kizildogan et al. 2017). Notably, the upreg -\nulation of genes associated with membrane transporters, \nthe CRISPR–Cas system, osmotic protection solutes, \noxidative stress proteins, and iron metabolism is closely linked to salt tolerance. This suggests that salt-tolerant \nmicroorganisms can respond to and resist high-salt \nenvironments by up-regulating the genes encoding their \ntransporters and transport systems, which is supported \nby similar reports (Zeng et  al. 2022). Up-regulation or \nexpression of genes encoding STPs can improve the salt \ntolerance of cells and prevent the cells from being killed \nby salt. A salt stress-responsive cysteine protease gene \nfrom Salix matsudana has been cloned and expressed \nin E. coli, which leads to the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ff07560a1ccf53b357fa1511fad0a4f9daaa393440f3791e17a43d7048c151ef_v2"}
