Compatible solutes of halophilic/halotolerant eubacte- \nria. (A) Non-reducing sugars and dimethylsulfoniopropionate. \n(B) Amino acids and derivatives. Polyols like glycerol and \narabitol, common in halophilic/osmophilic algae, yeast and \nfungi, have so far not been found in bacteria. The use of \nglutamine (not shown) as a compatible solute is restricted by \nits low solubility. Zwitterionic sulfur compounds like dimeth- \nylsulfoniopropionate have so far only been observed in \ncyanobacteria and marine algae. \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/15/2-3/95/616066 by guest on 21 April 2025\ning hypothesis of regulation, where methylation is \ninhibited by the reaction product S-adenosyl ho- \nmocysteine. A reversible S-adenosyl-homocy- \nsteine hydrolase is stimulated by betaine in the \ndirection of S-adenosyl homocysteine formation, \nwhereas potassium stimulates hydrolysis of S- \nadenosyl homocysteine to homocysteine. This way \nthe level of inhibition and the cytoplasmic con- \ncentration of betaine is regulated. \nBiosynthesis of ectoine proceeds via aspartie \nsemialdehyde (off-branch of aspartate family) and \nrequires three additional enzymes: diaminobu- \ntyrate transaminase, diaminobutyrate acetylase \nand Ny-acetyldiaminobutyrate dehydratase [72]. \nDue to the steric configuration of hydroxyectoine \n(S,S-c~-amino-/3-hydroxy form), an analogous bit)- \nsynthetic pathway with erythro-/3-hydroxyaspar- \ntate (from glyoxylate + glycine) seems likely, how- \never, subsequent hydroxylation of ectoine or one \nof its precursors cannot be excluded. The fact \nthat relatively few and common enzymatic reac- \ntions form the basis for the biosynthesis of these 103 \ntwo novel solutes probably explains why ectoines \nare so widespread among halophilic bacteria. \nA summary of known and hypothetical path- \nways of compatible solutes is given in Fig. 2. The \nillustration shows that the other solutes such as \nglutamine amide derivatives (Proteobacteria of \nthe ~- and y-subclass), proline, N6-acetylornith- \nine and Ne-acetyllysine (some bacilli and related \norganisms) are probably synthesized via pathways \nconnected to the glutamate family. It has never \nbeen shown but always assumed that osmotically \nused proline is synthesized by the same pathway \nas the proteinogenic compound. As independent \nregulation of both functions is vital, the possibil- \nity of separate pathways has to be considered. \nSome organisms display a characteristic change \nfrom proline to N,%acetylornithine and one is, \ntherefore, tempted to assume common biosyn- \nthetic sequences (possibly involving ornithine 6- \naminotransferase). The ability to synthesize and \nuse N-acetylated diamino acids as compatible \nsolutes seems to be typical for members of the \nco 2 Pyr \n\" ~ CO2 NaAcGlutaminyl- \n~e Asn AcCoA ~ glutamine amide Met \nTbr * I \"'-'~ [~\" I NaCarbamoy I- \n~, i Asp • OxAC Citr 4l glutamine amide H°m°Se~\" I /3OHAsp /~ G~ Mal \"~ \n, •1' ~ liitr n \nLys \"4- -4- 4- -AspSA Furn \ni~fiL~a?j Suet \"/ aOGlut ---* Glu ...... -~Arg \nDABA • ~ ' I ' ; GluSA ~ ~ =Ornithine \nLys \nINEAcLys,nel jNeAcLysine I elyo.  \nI , ~.._ SAM \n~Hydroxyectoinel $~-SAHC INSAcOrnitNne[ \nFig. 2.
