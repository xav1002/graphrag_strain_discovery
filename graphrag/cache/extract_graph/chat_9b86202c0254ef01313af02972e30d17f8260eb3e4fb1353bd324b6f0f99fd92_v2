Samples were collected at regular time inter-\nvals; the biomass growth was monitored by recording the\nabsorbance at 600 nm in spectrophotometer. The absorb-ance values were plotted against time to obtain growthcurves.\nValues showing an exponential phase and high biomass\nyield were found to be optimum. The isolated strains\n(P.aeruginosa, B.flexus, E.homiense and S.aureus ) were\ngrown in two different media (NB & Dundas) under sim-ilar physical environment and growth was ascertained bymeasuring optical density (at 600 nm) of culture for 24 h(results not shown). It was observed that bacterial growth\nwas maximum in nutrient broth- it being an indication\nthat the halotolerant bacterial strains were proteolytic innature, readily degrading the large amount of peptone,present in both media. Also, the halotolerant bacterialstrains exhibited a strong stationary phase up to 8 h in NBmedia as compared to the observed phase in Dunda'smedium. This pointed to the long survival ability of the\ncultures; NB was also found to be the ideal medium.\nSalinity optimization was a parameter of greater impor-tance as the halotolerant bacterial strains were to beemployed for biodegradation of tannery saline wastewa-ter.\nSalinity studies showed that P.aeruginosa as well as\nS.aureus adapted up to 5% (w/v) and B.flexus, E.homiense\nover a wide range (5%, 10% & 15%) of salinity (resultsnot shown). This meant that all the identified strains(P.aeruginosa , B.flexus, E.homiense and S.aureus ) were salt\ntolerant. Inoculum concentrations were changed from 2 –\n10% (v/v) for each strain, keeping other growth parame-\nters constant. Samples were withdrawn at regular timeintervals and analyzed for growth by recording absorb-ance value at 600 nm (results not shown). Maximum bio-mass yield was taken as criterion to find the optimumvalue. A 4% (v/v) inoculum conc. was found to be opti-\nmum for P.aeruginosa and B.flexus and 2% for E.homiense\nand S.aureus . Biological saline wastewater treatment\nshowed improved results when operated at low F/M forhigh salt concentrations [19]. Temperature optimizationstudies proved that all the 4 halotolerant bacterial isolateswere found to be mesophillic (results not shown) asenhanced biomass production was observed in this tem-\nperature range (32–37°C). As most of effluent treatment\nplants were operated in ambient conditions (especially intropical countries like India were normal day temperaturewas ≥ 30°C), the isolates could actively degrade the tan-\nnery saline wastewater. pH optimization results provedthat all the halotolerant bacterial isolates were found to be\nnuetrophile (pH 7.0 – 8.0). In soaking operation, com-\nmon salt was the main ingredient and it imparted a neu-tral pH to tannery wastewater. Hence no pH correctionwas needed when these strains were employed for biodeg-radation of tannery saline wastewater (they easily\nadapted). Optimization of agitation rate for the growth of\nidentified strains was taken up at different values viz., 100,120, 140, 160 and 180 rpm. This small increment in agi-tation rate showed significant variation in growth rate ofrespective strains. All the four salt tolerant strains showedoptimal growth at 160 rpm and a further increase in agi-\ntation rate caused observable fall in growth profile (results\nnot shown). This could be attributed to the effect of shearrate on cell wall, resulting in cell damage. Optimizationresults indicated that the identified halotolerant bacterialstrains could readily degrade tannery saline wastewater.The summaries of experiments for the 4 halotolerant bac-\nterial strains are in Table 1.\nTannery saline wastewater treatment\nTannery saline wastewater degradation studies were done\nas batch experiments (incubated shaking flask) with puremonocultures of P.aeruginosa, B.flexus, E.homiense and\nS.aureus and their mixed consortia. In CETPs, tannery\nsaline wastewater was segregated generally separately and\ntreated in solar ponds to prevent degeneration of tannerysludge in the bioreactor.
