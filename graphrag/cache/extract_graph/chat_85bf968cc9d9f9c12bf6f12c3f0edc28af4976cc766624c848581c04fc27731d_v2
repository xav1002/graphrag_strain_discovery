Out of total six isolates we \nhave found two isolates Exiguobacterium  sp. GSD1 (JN020918) and  Serratia sp. GSD2 (JN020917) with capability \nto adapt upto 10% of NaCl salt containing medium. \n \nExiguobacterium  sp. have been isolated from markedly diverse sourc es, including Greenland  glacial ice, hot springs \nat Yellowstone  park, rhizosphere of plant and environment of food  processing unit[10].Gram negative bacteria of the \ngenus Serratia are opportunistic human, plant and insect pathogen s[11]and member of the family \nenterobacteriaceae [12]. Salinity has an effect on microbial cell memb rane[13] and synthesis, structure and function \nof protein [14,15] as well as the growth of the mic roorganisms [16]. Bacteria develop different defens e mechanisms \nto survive in high salinity environment [17].Presen t study evaluates the adaptation capabilities of ag ricultural soil \nmicroorganisms in high NaCl containing medium to pr opose its futuristic adaption in salt contaminated soil, if \ntsunami like natural disaster strikes or rise in se a level, change the fertility of soil. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nCollection of soil sample and physico-chemical anal ysis:  Soil sample was collected from provinces of “Van -\nVibhag” (agricultural soil) Saurashtra University c ampus, Rajkot, India. Soil sample was collected fro m the depth of \n10-12 inch in sterile polythene bag and samples wer e kept at room temperature until used. Soil analysi s was \nconducted to measure electro conductivity, pH, tota l nitrogen, K 2O, P2O5 content at the government soil analysis \nlaboratory, Rajkot.  \n \nIsolation and Screening of Bacteria : Soil suspension was prepared with 5g of soil in 2 0ml of sterile double \ndistilled water and vortexed. Loop full of soil sus pension was streaked on N-Agar plates (Himedia) and  incubated \nfor 24h at 37 °C for isolation of different bacteria.  Total six d ifferent isolates were found from primary screening  \nand further grown on N-agar plate containing 2%, 4% , 6%, 8% & 10% NaCl separately for 72h at 37 °C. \n \nBiochemical Characterization: Biochemical analysis of two isolates were carried o ut according to Bergey’s \nManual of Determinative Bacteriology[18] and classi fied primarily through morphological, physiological  and \nbiochemical  observation.   \n \nAmplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA encoding g enes: 16S rDNA genes, from the purified genomic DNA \nof the 2 isolates were amplified by PCR with the fo llowing set of primers: F (5´-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-\n3´) and R (5´-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3´). Each 50-µl r eaction mixture contained 30 mM Tris (pH 8.4), \n50mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 50mM concentrations of each dNTPs, 10 pmol of eac h primer, and 1U of Taq \npolymerase. The PCR was performed  with following s pecification: first step of denaturation for 5 min at 95°C,  30 \ncycles were performed, denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55°C, and polymerization  for 1 min at \n72°C. The amplified genes were sequenced using sequ ence scanner v1.0 (Inst Model/Name: 3730XI/ABI3730X L-\n1414-008) (Applied Biosystems). \n \nPhylogenetic analysis: The 16S rDNA gene sequences of two isolates ( Exiguobacterium sp.  GSD1, Serratia \nsp.GSD2) were compared to references of 16S rDNA ge ne sequences retrieved from GenBank database. BLAST N \n2.2.26+ used to retrieve similar reference sequence s and aligned for phylogenetic relationship with ou r isolated \nstrain by neighbor-joining method using treedyn onl ine software. \n Gaurav S.
