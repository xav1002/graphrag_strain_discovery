Studies have shown \nthat the hydrophobicity of internal amino acid residues of \nproteins is strongly related to the stability of the internal \nstructure (Gromiha et  al. 1999). The greater hydropho -\nbicity of these internal amino acid residues is benefi -\ncial for maintaining the internal stability of the protein. \nOne possible explanation for the greater stability of the \nalkaline protease from A. oryzae compared to the neu -\ntral protease is that the alkaline protease has a higher \nmolar ratio of hydrophobic amino acid residues (such as \nalanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and \nmethionine) than the neutral protease (Gao et al. 2019). \nHowever, proteins responding to high salt environments \noften exhibit low levels of hydrophobic and lysine resi -\ndues (Ortega et  al. 2011). Due to the tendency of large \nhydrophobic residues to form helixes, a significant \nreduction in the number of these residues may lead to \nincreased flexibility, which may be a factor in salt adapta -\ntion (Hu et al. 2022; Paul et al. 2008).\nAs previously discussed, ordered secondary structures, \nhigh surface acidic amino acid content, increased sur -\nface negative charge, changes in internal hydrophobicity, \nand the formation and enrichment of salt bridges seem \nto be general strategies to improve the salt adaptation \nof STPs in high salt concentration conditions (Fig.  3). \nHowever, these mechanisms may not be universal (Brit -\nton et al. 1998), and future studies should further explore the salt-tolerant mechanism of STPs. For some STPs, the \npresence of salt is essential to restore their active struc -\ntural conformations (Mevarech et al. 2000). These STPs \nrequire the presence of high salt concentrations to exhibit \ngood solubility, stability, and catalytic activity, indicat -\ning their dependence on salt (Enache and Kamekura \n2010; González-Hernández and Peña 2002; Mokashe \net  al. 2018). Meanwhile, some STPs do not depend on \nthe presence of salt, but their activity and stability may \nbe inhibited under high-salt conditions (Jothi Basu et al. \n2015). Interestingly, due to the employment of multiple \nsalt-adaptation strategies, some STPs not only tolerate or \nrequire high salt concentrations. They also maintain their \nactive conformation and good stability in a variety of \norganic solvents and cataclysmic reagents (Mokashe et al. \n2018; Sinha and Khare 2014). The multiple salt adapta -\ntion strategy allows STPs to maintain stability and better \ncatalytic activity at high salt concentrations compared \nto common proteases. Under harsh conditions (such as \nsalt, organic solvents, oxidants, and bleach), the activ -\nity of common proteases is inhibited or even denatured, \nresulting in incomplete hydrolysis of substrate proteins \nand limited production of small molecule peptides and \namino acids (Rodriguez-Rios et al. 2022; Sana et al. 2006). \nHowever, under the same conditions, STPs exhibit supe -\nrior stability and catalytic properties, allowing them to \nhydrolyze substrate proteins into abundant peptides and \nsmall amino acids (Hou et al. 2020; Mokashe et al. 2018). \nTherefore, due to their outstanding performance under \nharsh conditions, STPs are a top consideration for appli -\ncations in the modern biotechnology industry (Liu et al. \n2023; Sana et al. 2006).\nUsing modern biotechnology to improve the salt tolerance \nof proteases\nWhile STP-producing microorganisms or new STPs \nhave been discovered from natural environments using \nvarious screening techniques, the utilization of proteases \nshould not only focus on the most effective approach to \nisolate potential enzymes from microorganisms or natu -\nral environments, but also consider modifying enzymes \nthrough available biotechnology methods to enhance \ntheir properties. Various biotechnology techniques have \nbeen reported to improve the properties of STPs, such as \ngenetic engineering techniques (Hou et al. 2019), immo -\nbilization techniques (Dong et  al. 2022), and computer-\naided design techniques (Takenaka et  al. 2022). These \ntechniques play an important role in improving the activ -\nity and stability of enzymes.\nGenetic engineering techniques are known to transfer \ntarget genes encoding STPs into recipient cells, thereby \nenabling over-expression of enzymes and enhancing \nenzyme activity. For example, the serine protease gene isp Page 15 of 23\n Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \n \nof salt-tolerant Bacillus  sp.  LCB10 has been expressed in \nE. coli, leading to highly salt-tolerant proteases (Hou et al. \n2019). The enzyme maintains 86% activity in the presence \nof 7% NaCl.
