This strain has shown potential to produce \nan extracellular serine protease, which further expands \nthe range of STP species available for study and appli -\ncation. A recently discovered extracellular haloprotease \nhas been successfully isolated and purified from Bacillus \nlicheniformis KB111 (Foophow et  al. 2022). With their \ndistinctive enzymatic properties, these proteases have \nfound a wide range of applications in diverse industries \nincluding detergents, leather production, food process -\ning, medicine, textiles, and environmental protection. For \ninstance, the alkaline serine protease isolated and puri -\nfied from Bacillus velezensis  SW5 exhibits remarkable \nfibrinolytic activity, which is expected to achieve efficient \nfibrin hydrolysis in medical treatment (Yang et al. 2020). \nAdditionally, a novel halogen- and heat-resistant alka -\nline protease derived from Bacillus agaradhaerens strain \nAK-R has been purified, which may have potential appli -\ncability in laundry and pharmaceutical operations due \nto its exceptional tolerance to temperature, pH, and salt \nconcentration (Ibrahim et al. 2016).\nFungi represent a significant source of STPs, with \nnotable species including A. niger, A. oryzae, Aspergillus reticularis, Penicillium citrus, and Penicillium nalgio -\nvense (Foophow et  al. 2022; Lee et  al. 2010). Many of \nthese fungus-derived STPs have demonstrated potential \napplications in traditional high-salt fermented foods, \nsuch as soy sauce, shrimp paste, and fish paste. One \npromising example is the halotolerant alkaline serine \nprotease derived from Penicillium citrinum YL-1, which \nexhibits superior salt tolerance compared to proteases \nfrom other bacteria known for their high salt tolerance. \nThis characteristic makes it a promising candidate for \nthe hydrolysis of fish protein during fish sauce fermen -\ntation (Xie et al. 2016). A. oryzae 3.042, a strain isolated \nfrom traditional high-salt foods, has been found to pro -\nduce not only alkaline proteases (Gao et al. 2019) but also \nsalt-tolerant neutral protease (Wang et  al. 2013), acid \nprotease (Lee et al. 2010), and aspartate aminopeptidase \n(Gao et al. 2018). These enzymes play a crucial role in the \nutilization of fermented food proteins and the produc -\ntion of flavor compounds. Similarly, the fungus A. niger, \ncapable of producing these enzymes simultaneously, has \nbeen employed in high-salt traditional foods alongside A. \noryzae to enhance product quality and flavor (Leng and \nXu 2011; Wahab and Ahmed 2018; Wang et al. 2021c ).\nArchaea has emerged as a novel and promising source \nof STPs. With increasing research on archaea, it has been \ndiscovered that many of these microorganisms can pro -\nduce STPs. These archaea include Haloarcula, Halococ -\ncus, and others (Abanoz et al. 2017; Gaonkar and Furtado \n2020; Hou et al. 2021). Haloarcula sp.  TG1, isolated from \nsalt mines and salt lakes, has been found to produce \nproteases with maximum activity at pH 4.0, 50  °C, and \n4  M NaCl (Abanoz et  al. 2017).
