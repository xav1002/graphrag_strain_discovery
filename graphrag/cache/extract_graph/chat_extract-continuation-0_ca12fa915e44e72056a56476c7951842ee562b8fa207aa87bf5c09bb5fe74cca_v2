Sulfotrehalose has thus far\nbeen found only in a few alkaliphilic members of the\nHalobacteriaceae ; it is accumulated in substantial concen-\ntrations (up to 1 M) in addition to KCl which serves as the\nmain osmotic solute like in their neutrophilic relatives\n[54].\nIn the kingdom Bacteria the largest diversity of organic\nsolutes is detected. Some compounds appear to be used\nby a wide range of organisms.

Relatively\nfew prokaryotes are capable of de novo synthesis of the\ncompound. Notably these are different types of pho-\ntotrophs: halophilic cyanobacteria as well as anoxygenic\nphototrophs such as Halorhodospira spp. Occurrence of\nglycine betaine biosynthesis in the heterotrophic Actinop-\nolyspora halophila (Actinobacteria ) has been established\nlong ago. In recent years the list of non-phototrophic\nprokaryotes capable of de novo production of glycine\nbetaine as regulated by the extracellular salt concentration\nhas grown. The methanogenic archaeon Methanohalo-\nphilus portucalensis synthesizes glycine betaine by reductive\nmethylation of glycine that is generated from serine\n[50,56-59]. In contrast, the far less halotolerant Meth-\nanosarcina mazei does not produce glycine betaine, but\naccumulates the compound from the medium when\nexposed to salt stress. Recently evidence was obtained for\nde novo biosynthesis of glycine betaine also in the haloal-\nkaliphilic chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing Proteobacte-\nria Thioalkalibacter and Thioalkalivibrio [60,61], but no\ninformation is as yet available about the biosynthetic\npathway used and its regulation.\nFar more abundant than glycine betaine as compatible\nsolute in the domain Bacteria are the cyclic amino acidderivatives ectoine and hydroxyectoine, originally discov-\nered in anoxygenic phototrophs of the Ectothiorhodospira –\nHalospira group [48]. Ectoine is now known to be synthe-\nsized by many aerobic heterotrophic bacteria [5,49].\nEctoine was also recently identified as a major osmotic\nsolute in halophilic methanotrophs and methylotrophs\n[62,63].\nThe list of organic compatible solutes that have been iden-\ntified is long, and Fig. 4 gives a representative selection\nonly. Some compounds are widespread along the phylo-\ngenetic tree, while others appear to be limited to selected\ngroups. For example, glucosylglycerol is almost exclu-\nsively found in moderately halophilic or highly halotoler-\nant cyanobacteria, but has been detected in some\npseudomonads as well [64,65]; N ε-acetyl-α-lysine and\nNδ-acetylornithine have thus far been detected only in\naerobic members of the Firmicutes . Another compound of\ninterest is proline, found especially in the Firmicutes\n[66,67], but also present in halophilic/halotolerant dia-\ntoms [68]. A special biosynthetic pathway for the produc-\ntion of proline for osmotic purposes has been detected in\nBacillus subtilis [69].Distribution within the phylogenetic tree  of micro\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you provided two separate texts, and I'll do my best to provide a response based on the second text.\n\nThe output is a list of organic osmotic solutes found in halophilic and halotolerant prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.
