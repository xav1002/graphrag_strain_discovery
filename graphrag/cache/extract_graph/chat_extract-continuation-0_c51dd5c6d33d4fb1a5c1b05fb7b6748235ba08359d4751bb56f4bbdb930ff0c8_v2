Due to the controver-\nsial role of ethylene in plant abiotic stress tolerance, further inves-\ntigation of the signaling perception in the ethylene signaling\npathway upon ACC treatment, ACC deaminase and KMBA is needed\nto clarify the contradictory phenomenon.\nRecently, two research groups simultaneously increased the\ninteraction between microbe-induced plant salt tolerance and\nplant immunity. Loo et al. [122] proposed that microbe-\nassociated molecular patterns (MAMPs) responsible for plant\npattern-triggered immunity (PTI) could induce Arabidopsis salt tol-\nerance when sensed by pattern-recognizing receptors (PRRs), a\nmechanism termed pattern-triggered salt tolerance (PTST). Rolli\net al. [123] demonstrated that LYK4, which is responsible for the\nplant perception of chitin that triggers PTI, mediates Enterobacter\nsp.-triggered salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana . These studies\nhelp to make sense of the crosstalk between microbe-induced bio-\ntic stress resistance and microbe-induced abiotic stress tolerance.\n4. Summary and perspective\nDue to the requirements of sustainable development and the\nmultifunctional property of rhizosphere microbes, developing a\nmicrobial inoculant-based strategy is a promising direction for\ncrop cultivation in saline soil. In recent years, scientists have drawnmuch attention to the isolation of strains and their effects on ion/\nosmotic balance, cell damage prevention and growth promotion of\nplants under saline stress. However, several issues remain that\nrestrict the microbial strategy from taking further steps as a solu-\ntion for enhancing crop tolerance in saline land.\n1) The microbe-produced signaling molecules responsible for\ninducing plant salt tolerance are still lacking and remain to\nbe identiÔ¨Åed. The identiÔ¨Åcation of these molecules may sup-\nport the development of chemical agents for promoting pro-\nduction in saline soil.\n2) The detailed mechanisms by which microbes enhance plant\nsalt tolerance, which is important for agricultural produc-\ntion, need to be deeply investigated. For example, many pub-\nlications have demonstrated the regulation of plant NHXs or\nHKTs by microbes, but the underlying mechanisms are not\nclear. The mechanisms pertaining to the regulation of photo-\nsynthesis, antioxidants, osmolytes and growth by microbes\nare also not clear.\n3) Some microbial species show efÔ¨Åciency in helping with\nplant tolerance to salt stress but are difÔ¨Åcult to industrialize\ndue to their relatively weak adaptability to either the pro-\nduction environment, storage environment, or saline soil\nenvironment. Therefore, matched technologies for microbial\nagent production and application need to be developed.\n4) Enhancing crop production in saline soil is the Ô¨Ånal scope of\nresearch on microbe-induced plant salt tolerance, but there\nis still a lack of reports on the effect of microbial application\non crop production in large-scale Ô¨Åeld experiments in saline\nsoil, especially for some typical large saline soil land areas.\nThe effects of microbes on crop production in different kinds\nof saline land may vary due to other factors, such as climate\nand soil type.Y.
