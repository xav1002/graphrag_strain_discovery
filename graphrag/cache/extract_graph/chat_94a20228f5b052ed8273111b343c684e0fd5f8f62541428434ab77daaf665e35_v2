Among these, the role of th e\nbranched chain amino acid (BCAA) ABC transporter protein\nand glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase in osmotolerance are\nwell documented ( Takami et al., 2002; Brosnan and Brosnan,\n2006), while the scanty information is available about role\nfor STKc_PknB and DUF3445 protein in stress maintenance\n(Hatziosetal.,2013 ).\nABC branched chain amino acid (BCAA) transporters are\nwidelydistributedinvariousmarinemicrobeslike Oceanibacillus\niheyensis (Takami et al., 2002 ),Salinispora, Bacillus, and\nRoseobacter strains (Penn and Jensen, 2012 ).

In the presence of 2-oxoglutarate a nd\npyridoxal-5-phosphate, these branched chain amino acids are\nfurther converted to L-glutamate by branched chain amino ac id\ntransferase ( Hutson, 2001 ). Accumulated glutamate acts as an\nosmoprotectant upon hyper-osmotic shock and activates sets of\ngenes that allow the host to achieve long-term adaptation to\nhigh osmolarity ( Gralla and Vargas, 2006 ). They also account\nfor a signiﬁcant proportion of the genes observed in the\nmarinemetagenome.Branchedchainaminoacidtransportersa re\nprobably an important marine adaptation because accumulated\nglutamate may function as a counter ion for K+, which balances\nthe electrical state of the cytoplasm ( Penn and Jensen, 2012 ).\nPreviousstudieshavereportedaregulatoryrelationshipbe tween\nK+and glutamate accumulation in response to osmotic stress\nin enteric bacteria and haloalkaliphilic archaea Natronococcus\noccultus (Kokoeva et al., 2002 ). Similarly, T. consotensis, a\nhalotolerant bacterium accumulates glutamate to maintain\nelectrical equilibrium within the cell in response to high sa lt\nconcentrations( Rubiano-Labradoretal.,2015 ).Thisbackground\ninformation explains the possible physiological role of the\nBCAA_ABCTPgeneof pSSR1toincreasehostosmotolerance.\nGlucose/Sorbosonedehydrogenase(G SDH)isresponsiblefor\ntheproductionofNADPHthroughoxidativecleavageofglucos e\n(Oubrieetal.,1999 ).Undersaltstresscondition,NADPHactsas\nreducing potential for output of reduced glutathione (GSH) an d\ninvolvedinactivityofmembraneboundNADPHoxidase,which\nresults in accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) (Wang\net al., 2008 ). H2O2acts as a signal in regulating G6PDH activity\nand expression of this enzyme in the glutathione cycle throug h\nwhich the ability of GSH regeneration was increased under sa lt\nstress (Wang et al., 2008 ). Thus, G6PDH plays a critical role\nin maintaining cellular GSH levels under long-term salt str ess\nconditions ( Wang et al., 2008 ). It indicates that GSDHofpSSR4\nis involved in salt stress tolerance possibly through the cyt osolic\naccumulationofreducingequivalents(NADPHandGSH).\nWhile in case of pSSR6only one ORFwas identiﬁed,\nsharing homology with Serine/Threonine kinases.

STKs are well known for activating genetic locus\nconcerned with osmosensing ( Hatzios et al., 2013 ) and inducing\ntopological changes such as DNA supercoiling ( Gupta et al.,\n2014). These osmosensing signal and DNA supercoiling could\ninitiate uptake of the osmolyte glycine betaine, proline ( Csonka,\n1989) or initiates the expression of genetic elements required tocope with osmotic stress ( Higgins et\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_94a20228f5b052ed8273111b343c684e0fd5f8f62541428434ab77daaf665e35_v2"}
