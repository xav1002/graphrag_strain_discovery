Osmotic balance\nSoil salinity is always accompanied by hyperosmotic stress in\nplants. A high salt concentration is hyperosmotic to plant cells\nand will affect root water absorption or even water loss. This situ-\nation also limits the uptake of nutrients by roots and results in ABA\naccumulation. ABA signaling will lead to stomatal closure, which\nrestricts transpiration and thus makes it harder to absorb water\nFig. 1. Mechanisms by which microbes enhance plant salt tolerance. 1. To re-establish the ion balance of plants under salt stress, microbes reduce the Na+content in the\ncytoplasm by decreasing Na+uptake, increasing Na+efﬂux and comparting Na+into vacuoles. To regulate the osmotic balance of plants under salt stress, microbes produce\nosmolytes and induce plants to produce osmolytes, and they also reduce ABA to increase water uptake. 2. To prevent ROS-induced damage to plants under s alt stress,\nmicrobes can reduce plant ROS generation and stimulate plants to scavenge ROS. 3. To resume plant growth under salt stress, microbes promote photosyn thesis and produce\nACC deaminase or other compounds to regulate plant ethylene signaling.Y. Liu, W. Xun, L. Chen et al. Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 20 (2022) 6543–6551\n6546and reduce photosynthesis. Accumulating soluble osmoprotectants\nin the cytoplasm is a general strategy to counter hyperosmotic\nstress. These osmolytes, including charged metabolites, polyols,\nsoluble sugars and complex sugars, vary based on plant species [2].\nMost of the microbes that show mitigation effects on plant salt\nstress also increase the WUE and stimulate the production of dif-\nferent kinds of osmolytes by plants. The production of osmolytes\nunder saline conditions can be controlled by microbes. For exam-\nple, Bacillus subtilis GB03 produced VOCs that induced glycine\nbetaine production by Arabidopsis under saline conditions in an\nABA-dependent manner [81]. The mutation of trehalose synthesis\ninPseudomonas putida UW4 completely blocked the promotion of\ntomato root development and growth under saline conditions, sug-\ngesting a critical role of microbe-produced osmolytes in plant salt\ntolerance [90,91] . Salt stress-induced ABA accumulation is believed\nto be a signature of the stress response and contributes to stomatal\nclosure [92]. Although ABA and proline accumulation in salt-\nstressed plants generally occurs, inoculation with microbes has\ninconsistent effects on ABA and proline contents under salt stress.\nWhile most studies propose that the observed ABA reduction in\nplants upon microbial inoculation is responsible for restoration of\nthe osmotic balance under salt stress, Bacillus licheniformis SA03\n[93],Paenibacillus yonginensis DCY84T [94] and Bacillus mesonae\nH20-5 [95] increased the ABA contents in Chrysanthemum ,Panax\nginseng and tomato under saline conditions, respectively. By\ninhibiting ABA synthesis using ﬂuridone, Zhou et al. [93] demon-\nstrated the key role of SA03-induced ABA in enhancing plant salt\ntolerance. The effects of microbial inoculations on plant proline\naccumulation upon saline stress also vary, and the physiological\nsigniﬁcance of proline accumulation in salt-stressed plants is con-\ntroversial ( Table S1 ). Proline protects plants from saline stress by\nincreasing the osmosis of the cytoplasm and is induced upon salt\nstress and strengthened by microbial inoculation. However, a\ndecrease in proline in inoculated plants compared with that of\nnoninoculated plants under saline conditions has also been widely\nreported [53,96–98] . Proline is an osmolyte and a signature of the\nstress response. Increased levels of proline upon microbial inocula-\ntion undoubtedly beneﬁt salt tolerance, but the decreased levels of\nproline upon inoculation can also reﬂect a decrease in salt stress\n[99]. Therefore, the observed inconsistency in proline accumula-\ntion may also be due to the difference in the stress period. As plant\nendogenous osmolytes, proline and poly- c-glutamic acid produced\nby microbes can also protect plants directly or act as a signal to\ninduce plant salt tolerance [100,101] .\n3.2. Preventing damage to plant cells\nStress signaling following Ca2+inﬂux is always accompanied by\nROS production [102] . ROS act as critical signals by activating var-\nious secondary messengers in the stress response, but they are also\ndeleterious to plant cells by impairing DNA, proteins and lipids\nwhen they accumulate in plant cells [103] . The cell damage caused\nby ROS, including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl\nradical, and singlet oxygen, is irreversible, especially for the elicita-\ntion of programmed cell death when hydroxyl radicals are pro-\nduced [103] . Under normal conditions, ROS production and\nelimination are balanced; however, salt stress causes an imbalance\ndue to the increase in ROS [102] . It is widely reported that plant\nelectrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you have provided a scientific article on the effects of microorganisms on plant salt tolerance.
