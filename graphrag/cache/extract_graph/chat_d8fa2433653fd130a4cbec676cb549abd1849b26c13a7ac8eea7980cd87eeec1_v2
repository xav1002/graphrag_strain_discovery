Trfiper, unpublished re- \nsuits). With a view to the regulation of trehalose \ncontent, some properties of the cleaving enzyme \ntrehalase are worth noting. The enzyme is inhib- \nited by salt and activated in the presence of \nglycine betaine, which also confers a partial pro- \ntection against salt. In addition, it exhibits a very \nhigh Kin-value for the substrate trehalose (0.5 \nM), close to the maximal concentration reported \nin cells exposed to nitrogen limitation [58]. In the \npresence of glycine betaine this constant is re- \nduced to 0.16 M promoting degradation, hence \nglycine betaine seems to have a regulatory effect \non trehalose levels in the cytoplasma. These find- \nings are in agreement with the physiological ob- \nservation that trehalose is only accumulated un- \nder nitrogen-limited conditions (replacing nitro- \ngen-containing solutes) and immediately \nmetabolised upon relief of nitrogen stress. \nContrary to the pathway in cyanobacteria and \nin plants of the family Chenopodiaceae biosyn- \nthesis of betaine in Ectothiorhodospira species \nproceeds via direct methylation of glycin using \nS-adenosyl methionine as a methyl donor (I. \nTschichholz and H.G. Triper, unpublished re- \nsuits). Using beta/betB gene probes, the pres- \nence of the genes for choline oxidation (betaine \naldehyde dehydrogenase, choline oxidase) in \neyanobacteria and their absence in Ectothiorho- \ndo,spira species has been demonstrated (O. Matan \nand E. Tel-Or, pers. comm.). In view of the \nobserved CO, release from acetate and remark- \nably high activities of 5,10-methylene-THF-dehy- \ndrogenase, a methyl-group supply by cleavage of \nglyoxylate and subsequent reduction of formyl- \nTHF has been proposed [49,69]. Recently, again \nusing NMR spectroscopic evidence, betaine syn- thesis from glycine has also been proposed for \narchaebacterial methanogens [56]. Therefore, \nphylogenetically distant groups may well share \nsimilar pathways of compatible solute synthesis. \nOn the basis of their observations with cyanobac- \nteria, Sibley and Yopp [73] proposed an intrigu- \nA \nCH, OH EHoOH \nOH \nHOEH~ HO--~HO ~ ~H \nSucrose Trehalose \nEHOH CH, \nHO ~\"~H 0 ' CH~SQ~/'~CO 0 \nO EHzOH \nH'~CH~OH Dlmethylsulfonio- \nGlqcosylglycerol propmnate \nE5 \nCH%/ Q ° :oo \n1 \\ \"/~\"KH \nCH 3 0\"1 K \nBetalne Prollne \nH\"/~/R 0 \nCH CO0° ~ /'\"ICH )/j~/NH, CHf N ~ ~o j'\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d8fa2433653fd130a4cbec676cb549abd1849b26c13a7ac8eea7980cd87eeec1_v2"}
