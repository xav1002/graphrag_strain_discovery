Trichoderma spp.\nTrichoderma spp. are free-living soil ﬁlamentous fungi that are\nbeneﬁcial to plants [32].Trichoderma strains are nonsymbiotic,\nwhile some strains can infect root outer cells [32].Trichoderma\nhas diverse beneﬁcial functions for plants, such as enhancing plant\nstress resistance and promoting plant growth. T. harzianum, T.\nvirens, T. atroviride, T. asperelloides, T. longibrachiatum, T. yunna-\nnense, and T. afroharzianum have shown the ability to promote seed\ngermination and plant growth of Arabidopsis (up to 100 mM NaCl)\n[33],cucumber (up to 200 mM NaCl) [34],wheat (up to 200 mM\nNaCl) [6]and barley (up to 200 mM NaCl) [35] under salt stress\n(Table S1 ). These strains promoted root development and affected\nroot system architecture. In addition, most Trichoderma strains iso-\nlated from soil are efﬁcient decomposers of dead plant residues\nthat drive soil carbon cycling and plant growth [32].Trichoderma\nstrains are not an outstanding microbial group regarding salt toler-\nance when compared with some bacterial strains, such as Bacillus\nspp. and Enterobacter spp. Contreras-Cornejo et al. [36] demon-\nstrated that 200 mM NaCl signiﬁcantly inhibited the hyphal\ngrowth of T. virens and T. atroviride . Zhang et al. [37] found similar\nresults that 30 mg/mL NaCl inhibited the growth of Trichoderma\nlongibrachiatum T6. Therefore, both salt tolerance for itself and\nplant salt tolerance enhancement are necessary for the successful\ncultivation of a good functional Trichoderma isolate in saline soil.\n2.3. Serendipita indica (formerly Piriformospora indica)\nPiriformospora indica is a natural soil-inhabiting ﬁlamentous\nfungus that promotes plant growth upon symbiosis. P. indica is\nan endophyte for a broad range of host plants (Franken 2012). It\nwas ﬁrst isolated from an AMF spore by Verma et al. in 1998. How-\never, unlike AMF, P. indica can be cultivated on deﬁned media. Sev-\neral reviews have concluded the beneﬁcial effects of P. indica on\nplants [10,38–40] . In recent years, P. indica has shown impressive\npotential in mitigating salt stress in Arabidopsis (up to 200 mM\nNaCl) [41],rice(up to 300 mM NaCl) [42],barley (up to 300 mM\nNaCl) [43] and tomato (up to 150 mM NaCl) [44] (Table S1 ). Lanza\net al. [45] demonstrated that free-living P. indica is sensitive to salt;\nit can only tolerate up to 100 mM NaCl, and hyphal growth was sig-\nniﬁcantly inhibited due to the toxic effect of Na+rather than osmo-\ntic stress. Interestingly, Vahabi et al. [41] demonstrated that the\ngrowth promotion of Arabidopsis seedlings under salt stress isY. Liu, W. Xun, L. Chen et al. Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 20 (2022) 6543–6551\n6544strongly dependent on physical contact between the two\nsymbionts.\n2.4. Enterobacter spp.\nThe speciﬁc role of Enterobacter spp. as beneﬁcial endophytes in\nenhancing plant salt tolerance has been demonstrated in their\ninteractions with Arabidopsis (up to 200 mM NaCl) [46],rice(up\nto 150 mM NaCl) [47],wheat (up to 200 mM NaCl) [48],maize\n(electrical conductivity (EC) up to 13.6 dS/m) [49],tomato (up to\n200 mM NaCl) [46],mung bean (1 % NaCl) [50],okra (75 mM NaCl)\n[51] and quinoa (400 mM NaCl) [52] (Table S1 ).Enterobacter spp.\nwere ﬁrst recognized as beneﬁcial plant bacteria due to ACC deam-\ninase activity [53].Enterobacter sp. SA187 is a well-studied isolate\nthat promotes plant growth under salt stress. It seems that the\nmodulation of ethylene signaling in plants plays a key role in\nSA187-induced salt tolerance [54]. Ali et al. [55] demonstrated that\nE. cloacae PM2 can survive under salinity stress of up to 3 M NaCl in\nLuria-Bertani (LB) medium. However, the careful selection of plant-\nsafe strains is necessary given that members of the Enterobacter\ngenus are generally known as opportunistic pathogens of plants\nand humans [56].\n2.5. Bacillus spp.\nBacillus spp. are gram-positive spore-forming bacteria from the\nphylum Firmicutes and represent the most widely used and well-\nstudied bacteria in agricultural production. Most of the Bacillus\nstrains that are beneﬁcial to plants belong to the subtilis subgroup.\nThese bacteria are generally root surface colonizers or root endo-\nphytes that exert\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that there is no output related to the original problem you provided.
