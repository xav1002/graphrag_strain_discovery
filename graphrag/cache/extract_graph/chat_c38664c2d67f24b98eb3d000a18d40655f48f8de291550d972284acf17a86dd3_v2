Within the Eur-\nyarchaeota we encounter the order Halobacteriales with a\nsingle family, the Halobacteriaceae [16]. In the bacterial\nkingdom, the family Halomonadaceae (class Gammaproteo-\nbacteria , order Oceanospirillales ) predominantly contains\nhalophiles [17]. Members of the Halobacteriaceae and the\nHalomonadaceae are aerobic heterotrophs, some of which\nhave a limited potential for anaerobic growth. The thirdphylogenetically coherent group contains the anaerobicfermentative bacteria of the order Halanaerobiales (Firmi-\ncutes , families Halanaerobiaceae and Halobacteroidaceae )\n[18].\nOur understanding of the phylogenetic and physiological\ndiversity within the Halobacteriaceae and the Halomonad-\naceae has greatly increased in the past two decades. Exten-\nsive programs aimed at the sampling of salt lakes and\nother saline and hypersaline environments in different\ncountries have led to the characterization and taxonomicdescription of many new species, so that the number ofspecies names within these two families has increasedexponentially. The 1974 edition of 'Bergey's Manual ofDeterminative Bacteriology' listed 2 genera and 3 species\nwithin the family Halobacteriaceae [19]. The next edition\nof the handbook, published in 1989 under the new name'Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology', already had6 genera and 11 species [20]. The numbers of genera andspecies increased to 14 and 34, respectively in the 2001edition [21], and to date (March 2008) the names of noless than 26 genera and 91 different species of Halobacte-\nriaceae have been validly published under the rules of the\nInternational Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Fig.2, upper panel). With descriptions of eight additional newspecies listed as 'in press' in the International Journal ofSystematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (as of March 2,2008), the current trend is expected to continue at least for\nsome more time.\nMost species of Halobacteriaceae are true extreme halo-\nphiles according to Kushner's definition [2]. However,analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from environments\nwith salt concentrations below 100 g/l shows that the\nlower salinity boundary that allows development ofarchaeal halophiles may be substantially lower than thatof Halobacterium salinarum , Haloarcula marismortui , and\nother well-studied members of the group [22]. Descrip-tions of isolates phylogenetically affiliated with the Halo-\nbacteriaceae but with a relatively low salt requirement also\nstarted to appear in the literature. A saline spring in Okla-homa whose waters contain 7–10 g/l salt, a concentrationfar too low to support growth of most members of theHalobacteriaceae , recently yielded a novel species of Halof-\nerax, Haloferax sulfurifontis [23] and two species belonging\nto new genera: Haladaptatus paucihalophilus (the specific\nepithet signifying its low salt requirement) [24] andHalosarcina pallida [25]. The lower salinity boundary of\nthese species for growth is 60, 47, and 76 g/l, respectively,but the optimal salt concentrations and the maximalsalinity tolerated by these isolates are within the highranges normally encountered for members of the family.\nHalobacterium salinarum and most other species of Halo-\nbacteriaceae lyse when the salt concentration is lowered\nbelow 100 g/l. However, some of its relatives have aremarkable ability to withstand exposure to low salt con-centrations. Out of 131 isolates of Halobacteriaceae\nobtained from Spanish saltern ponds, 49 did not lyse in\n20 g/l salt and 13 even survived exposure to 10 g/l salt\n[26]. It was recently shown that isolates obtained fromJapanese salterns and affiliated with the genera Halococcus ,\nHalogeometricum and Haladaptatus may survive periods of\n1–9 days in salt solutions of seawater concentration [27].Haloferax sulfurifontis survived incubation for 24 h at\n10–20 g/l salt and 72 h in 30 g/l salt [23], and \nHaladapta-\ntus paucihalophilus cells even retained their viability after\nhaving been suspended for two weeks in distilled water[24]. The sediments of a British salt marsh yielded severalisolates of Halobacteriaceae , many of which closely related\nto Haladaptatus paucihalophilus , which grow slowly at sea-\nwater salinity [28].\nIt must be realized that there is no well-based species con-\ncept for the prokaryotes, and the same is therefore true forthe halophilic Archaea. The above-presented statistics ofthe number of species described are all based on somemore or less arbitrary ideas of how to define a species and\nwhen to decide whether a new isolate may belong to an\nalready known species or should be described as a novelone.
