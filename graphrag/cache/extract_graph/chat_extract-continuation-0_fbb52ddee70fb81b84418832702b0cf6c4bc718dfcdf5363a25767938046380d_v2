Introduction\nAgricultural production worldwide is facing the challenge of\nincreasing population size. Food production is increasingly\nrestricted by limited cultivated land due to soil degradation issues,\nsuch as salinization. Saline soil accounts for 6 % of the world’s total\nland area and is a severe hindrance to agricultural production [1].\nMost domesticated crops are salt sensitive and cannot be culti-\nvated in saline soil [2]. Currently, the increasing food demand of\nglobal populations makes ﬁnding a solution to enhance crop toler-\nance to salinity more urgent.\nAs the functions of rhizosphere microbes in plant ﬁtness have\nbeen recognized [3], many beneﬁcial microbes that help plants\ncope with salinity stress have been isolated and reapplied to the\nsoil to enhance crop production in saline soil. These microbes can\nbe used in different ways; the common method is to make micro-\nbial fertilizers or microbial agents [4,5] , which can be applied to\nthe soil directly or combined with chemical or organic fertilizers.\nIn addition, some strains can be coated on crop seeds before sow-\ning[6]. Their efﬁciency in increasing plant growth or promoting\nseed germination under saline conditions has been shown, indicat-\ning a role in the mitigation of salt stress-induced negative effects\non plants. The plant salt tolerance induced by some microbial\ngroups, such as bacterial endophytes [7], the halophyte micro-\nbiome [8], microbial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid\n(ACC) deaminase [9]or microbial coinoculation [10], has been\nreviewed, as well as the microbial metabolites responsible for\nenhancing plant salt tolerance [11]. However, a comprehensive\ncomparison of the microbial species that are able to confer plant\nsalt tolerance and the underlying mechanisms is still lacking.\nHere, we reviewed the fungal and bacterial isolates with clear\nevidence of promoting plant growth or seed germination under\nsaline stress. Speciﬁcally, we discussed the challenges for the agri-\ncultural application of each kind of microbial inoculant. We also\nsummarized the mechanisms by which microbes enhance plant\ntolerance to salt stress. The salt stress signaling and tolerance\nmechanism of plants have been well reviewed [2,12–18] and will\nnot be included in this review.\n2. Microbial taxa enhancing plant tolerance to salt stress\n2.1. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)\nAMF are well-known beneﬁcial fungi belonging to the phylum\nGlomeromycota that have close symbiotic interactions with their\nhost plants. The main function of AM symbiosis seems to be assist-\ning plants with nutrient uptake by extending the active absorption\narea of roots [10,19] . Several studies have also demonstrated the\neffect of AMF on plant productivity under salt stress. AMF, includ-\ning the genera Glomus ,Funneliformis ,Septoglomus ,Gigaspora ,Acau-\nlospora ,Claroideoglomus , and Rhizophagus (Funneliformis ,\nClaroideoglomus and Rhizophagus used to belong to Glomus ), have\nshown the capability to enhance plant salt tolerance ( Table S1 ).\nThe plants that showed enhanced production under saline stress\nupon AMF inoculation include lettuce (up to 80 mM NaCl) [20],\nmaize (up to 100 mM NaCl) [21], wheat (up to 200 mM NaCl)\n[22], rice (up to 120 mM NaCl) [23] and some leguminous (up to\n200 mM NaCl) [24] and woody plants ( Table S1 ). The characteris-tics and advances of AMF in mitigating plant salt stress include\nintegrity with signiﬁcantly enhanced plant nutrient uptake, such\nas nitrogen (N) and potassium (K), especially phosphorus (P)\n[25]. AMF-induced plant salt tolerance is always correlated with\nphosphorus, which plays an important role in photosynthesis to\nsupply energy for the stress response [26]. However, the symbiosis\nof AMF with plants is negatively affected by salt stress because\nAMF are not salt tolerant, which has been conﬁrmed by several\nstudies [25,27–30] . Pandey et al. [31] found that native AMF iso-\nlated from saline soil are more effective in mitigating the negative\neffect of salt stress on Cajanus cajan , suggesting that the salt toler-\nance of AMF themselves is also a limiting factor for performance\nunder salt stress.\n2.2. Trichoderma spp.\nTrichoderma spp. are free-living soil ﬁlamentous fungi that are\nbeneﬁcial to plants [32].Trichoderma strains are nonsymbiotic,\nwhile some strains can infect root outer cells [32].Trichoderma\nhas diverse beneﬁcial functions for plants, such as enhancing plant\nstress resistance and promoting plant growth.
