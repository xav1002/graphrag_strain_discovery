They noteda few regular patterns that link the physiological proper-ties of the halophilic organisms with their phylogeneticposition. Four such general observations were presented:\n(1) \"All eubacteria that gain energy from photosynthesis\nor oxygen-respiration and are capable of haloadaptation,are able to accumulate and/or produce compatible sol-utes.\"\n(2) \"Archaeobacteria and anaerobic fermenting eubacte-\nria are incapable of synthesizing organic compatible sol-utes.\"\n(3) \"Most eubacteria that can grow in non-complex media\nare capable of ectoine biosynthesis.\"\n(4) \"Extreme halophily in non-fermenting eubacteria is\nusually accompanied by glycine betaine biosynthesis. Thecomplete de novo synthesis of betaine from carbon diox-ide or simple organic carbon compounds has only beenproven for cyanobacteria, Ectothiorhodospira species and\nActinopolyspora halophila .\"\nIn the eighteen years that have passed since the Alicante\nmeeting our understanding of the salt-loving microbialworld has greatly increased. A large number of new halo-philic organisms have been discovered and described,including organisms phylogenetically unaffiliated to pre-\nviously known halophilic or halotolerant microorgan-\nisms. We have also obtained a deeper insight into thephysiological mechanisms used by different types of halo-philes to adapt to life in hypersaline environments.\nBased on the key words in the title of Prof. Trüper's talk –\n\"halophily\", \"taxonomy\", \"phylogeny\" and \"nomencla-\nture\", this paper first presents an overview of the novelinformation, followed by a reevaluation of the fourabove-cited general observations made in 1989.Halophily and the phylogenetic tree of life\nSalt dependence and salt tolerance are phenotypic charac-teristics generally included in the 'polyphasic' characteri-zation of newly discovered microorganisms toward theirdescription as new taxa with new names and the determi-nation of their position within the microbial taxonomy.There is no sharp definition of the term 'halophilic' – 'salt-\nloving'. Some use the term for all organisms that require\nsome level of salt for growth, including concentrationsaround 35 g/l as found in seawater. This is also reflectedin prokaryote nomenclature: there are quite a few bacteriawith the specific epithet ' halophilus ' (-a, -um) that are of\nmarine origin and do not tolerate salt concentrations\nmuch above those of seawater. Examples are Aestuarii-\nbacter halophilus , Algoriphagus halophilus (Hongiella halo-\nphila ), Arcobacter halophilus , Microbacterium halophilum ,\nand Terribacillus halophilus . The use of the specific epithet\nhalophilus to describe marine microorganisms should be\ndiscouraged, and it is recommended to reserve this namefor true halophiles adapted to life in hypersaline condi-\ntions.\nA survey of the salt relationships – the minimum salt con-\ncentration required for growth, the salinity optimum, andthe upper salt limit tolerated – within the microbial worldshows a continuum of properties, which makes it nearly\nimpossible to define by sharp boundaries what a halo-\nphile is. Moreover, the minimum, optimum and maxi-mum salt concentrations often depend on the mediumcomposition and growth temperature. The most widelyused definitions were formulated thirty years ago byDonn Kushner [2] who distinguished different categories:\nextreme halophiles (growing best in media containing\n2.5–5.2 M salt), borderline extreme halophiles (growingbest is media containing 1.5–4.0 M salt), moderate halo-philes (growing best in media containing 0.5–2.5 M salt),and halotolerant microorganisms that do not show anabsolute requirement for salt for growth but grow well up\nto often very high salt concentrations (considered\nextremely halotolerant if the growth range extends above2.5 M salt). These and similar definitions have proved val-uable in the classification of microorganisms according totheir relationship to salt [3-5]. For the discussions belowa simpler operative definition of what a halophile is willsuffice: microorganisms that grow optimally at salt con-\ncentrations of 50 g/l (equivalent to 0.85 M NaCl) or\nhigher, and tolerate 100 g/l salt (equivalent to 1.7 MNaCl) at least.\nWhen examining the distribution of halophiles, as based\non the above definition, within the small subunit rRNA\nsequence-based phylogenetic tree of life, it is clear that\nhalophiles are found in all three kingdoms: Archaea, Bac-teria, and Eukarya (Fig. 1) [3,4,6]. The figure indicateswhich groups of microorganisms contain halophilic rep-Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 3 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)resentatives. Groups marked as such do not necessarily\nconsist solely of halophiles. The opposite is true: there are\nonly a few phylogenetically consistent groups that are\ncomposed entirely of halophiles (see below).
