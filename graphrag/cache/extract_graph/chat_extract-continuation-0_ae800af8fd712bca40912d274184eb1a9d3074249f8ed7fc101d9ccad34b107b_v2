While the Pseudoalteromonas\ndropped sharply with the addition of salinity, even the abundance of\nPseudoalteromonas decreased to 0.003% at 9% salt concentration, which\ncould conclude that the Pseudoalteromonas was dramatically a ﬀected by\nhigher salinity (8% and 9% salinity). On the contrary, the Salinicola was\nnot detected at 0% salinity, while with the increasing salinity, theabundance of Salinicola gradually increased to 2.4%, 33.3%, 59.4% and\n92% at 3%, 6%, 8% and 9% salinity respectively. And the Salinicola\nbecame the most dominant genus of SAGS at 9% salinity in the SBR\nsystem. This increasing dynamic change indicated that the Salinicola\nwas capable to adapt the hypersaline stress and contributed a lot togranular sludge for the tolerance of salinity. In addition, the Halomonas\nappeared the similar increasing trend with the increase of salinity, and\ndominated in aerobic granular sludge, which was 24% relative abun-\ndance at 6% salt concentration. But with the enhanced salinity, the\nabundance of the Halomonas dropped from 6.83% to 0.1% at 8– 9%\nsalinity. The Bacillus was always existed in all sludge samples during the\nwhole process with the increase of salinity, and the abundance of this\ngenus was 3.88%, 8.38%, 7.34%, 5.2% and 4.7% respectively along\nwith the increasing salinity, indicating that the Bacillus could adapt the\nwide range of salt concentration (0 –9%). Bacillus, Pseudoalteromonas,\nHalomonas and other halophilic microorganisms were often isolated\nfrom di ﬀerent saline environments and some di ﬀerent strains even\nbelonged to the same genus ( Zhuang et al., 2010 ).\nFrom the microbial functional groups perspective, the existence of\nsome halophilic or halotolerant bacteria made aerobic granular sludge\nadapt to live and thrive in hypersaline stress. Moreover, saline condi-\ntions could stimulate bacteria produce more extracellular polymeric\nsubstances (EPS) to protect themselves from adverse environment. With\nthe increase of salinity step by step, an aerobic granular sludge system\ndominated by moderately halophilic genera was gradually formed withincreasing relative abundance of Salinicola andHalomonas. Besides, the\nSalinicola and Halomonas was the member of the family\nHalomonadaceae, which showed a remarkable versatility with respectto their salt tolerance ( Vargas and Nieto, 2004 ).de la Haba et al. (2010)\nfound that the Salinicola socius DSM 19940\nTgrew optimally in media\ncontaining 3– 10% NaCl and Halomonas salaria DSM 18044Tgrew op-\ntimally in media containing 10– 20% NaCl. The phylogenetic tree\n(Fig. 5) showed that Salinicola and Halomonas constituted a coherent\ncluster, which indicated that these two genera were phylogeneticallyclosely related and had same salt-tolerant function.\nMoreover, some researchers studied the e ﬀect of salinity on mi-\ncrobial community at the range of 0– 5% salt concentration, or detected\nthe microbial community using two or three di ﬀerent salinity level of\nsludge samples ( Ramos et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhao et al.,\n2016 ). In this study, the wider range of salinity level (0 –9%) and the\nstrategy of stepped increased of salinity provided more detailed mi-\ncrobial succession information of SAGS, and demonstrated the stepped\nincrease of the relative abundance of Salinicola with the increase of\nsalinity.\n3.4. Formation mechanism of SAGS\nThe formation of salt-tolerant granular could be explained as fol-\nlowing 3 mechanisms:(1) Crystal nucleus hypothesis considered the\nformation of granular sludge started with some nucleuses, which in-\noculated aerobic (anaerobic) granules, inorganic material or some in-\norganic salt into SBR system as a crystal nucleus, aerobic granular\nsludge will gradually form through microbial growth with the help of a\nnucleus ( Long et al., 2014 ). The nuclei of granular activated carbon\nprovided the supporting media for sludge to attach and enhance themorphological regularization of sludge ( Tao et al., 2017 ).Verawaty\net al. (2012) also found that ﬂocs were observed to attach to the surface\nof the seeding granules, resulting in reduced biomass washout during\ngranulation. In such experiment, the addition of anaerobic granules\nprovided the sludge for strong support medium in the initial start-upphase. On the basis of the anaerobic nucleus, young granules gradually\nformed with the growth of microbes. (2) Selection pressure hypothesis\ncould be separated as hydraulic selection pressure and biological se-\nlection pressure, which was widely used to optimize the operation\nparameters of reactor and to explain the formation of aerobic granular\nsludge. In such experiment, one selection pressure was the settling time,\nFig. 4.
