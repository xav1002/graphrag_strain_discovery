Within the Bacteria we know halophiles within the\nphyla Cyanobacteria , Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , Spirochaetes , and Bacteroidetes . Within\nthe Archaea the most salt-requiring mi croorganisms are found in the class Halobacteria .\nHalobacterium and most of its relatives require over 100â€“150 g/l salt for growth and structural\nstability. Also within the order Methanococci we encounter halophilic sp ecies. Halophiles and non-\nhalophilic relatives ar e often found together in the phylogeneti c tree, and many genera, families and\norders have representatives wi th greatly different salt requi rement and tolerance. A few\nphylogenetically coherent groups co nsist of halophiles only: the order Halobacteriales , family\nHalobacteriaceae (Euryarchaeota ) and the anaerobic fermenta tive bacteria of the order\nHalanaerobiales (Firmicutes ). The family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria ) almost exclusively\ncontains halophiles. Ha lophilic microorganisms use two stra tegies to balance their cytoplasm\nosmotically with their medium. The first involves  accumulation of molar concentrations of KCl.\nThis strategy requires adaptation of the intrac ellular enzymatic machinery, as proteins should\nmaintain their proper conformation and activi ty at near-saturating salt concentrations. The\nproteome of such organisms is highly acidic, an d most proteins denature when suspended in low\nsalt. Such microorganisms genera lly cannot survive in low salt me dia. The second strategy is to\nexclude salt from the cytoplasm and to synthesize and/or accumulate organi c 'compatible' solutes\nthat do not interfere with enzyma tic activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are needed,\nand organisms using the 'organic-solutes-in stra tegy' often adapt to a surprisingly broad salt\nconcentration range. Most halophilic Bacteria, but also the halophilic me thanogenic Archaea use\nsuch organic solutes. A variety of  such solutes are known, includ ing glycine betaine, ectoine and\nother amino acid derivatives, sugars and sugar alco hols. The 'high-salt-in strategy' is not limited to\nthe Halobacteriaceae . The Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes ) also accumulate salt rather than organic\nsolutes. A third, phylogeneticall y unrelated organism accumulates KCl: the red extremely halophilic\nSalinibacter (Bacteroidetes ), recently isolated from saltern crys tallizer brines. Analysis of its genome\nshowed many points of resemblance with the Halobacteriaceae , probably resulting from extensive\nhorizontal gene tran sfer. The case of Salinibacter shows that more unusual types of halophiles may\nbe waiting to be discovered.Published: 15 April 2008\nSaline Systems  2008, 4:2 doi:10.1186/1746-1448-4-2Received: 12 November 2007\nAccepted: 15 April 2008\nThis article is available from: http ://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nÂ© 2008 Oren; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons. org/licenses/by/2.0 ), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the orig inal work is properly cited.Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 2 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)Introduction\nAt the symposium on 'General & Applied Aspects of Halo-\nphilic Microorganisms', held in Alicante, Spain in Septem-ber 1989, Hans TrÃ¼per presented a lecture entitled:\"Halophily, taxonomy, phylogeny and nomenclature\".The talk summarized different aspects of the taxonomy ofhalophilic microorganisms, the phylogenetic position of\nthe different types of halophiles within the microbial\nworld, and the physiology of the diverse groups ofextreme and moderate halophiles. An attempt was madeto detect consistent patterns and correlations between thephylogeny of halophilic microorganisms and the waysthey cope with the high salt concentrations in the environ-\nment in which they live. A summary of this talk was pub-\nlished three years later in the proceedings volume of theAlicante meeting [1], and there Prof. TrÃ¼per and his cow-orkers presented a critical analysis of the data. They noteda few regular patterns that link the physiological proper-ties of the halophilic organisms with their phylogeneticposition.
