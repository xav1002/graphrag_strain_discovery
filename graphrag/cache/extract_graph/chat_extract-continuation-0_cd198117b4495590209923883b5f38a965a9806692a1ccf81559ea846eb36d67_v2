The improvement of salt tolerance of proteases \nbased on various modern biotechnologies needs to be \nestablished on the basis of elucidating the mechanism \nof salt tolerance of proteases. However, salt-tolerant \nmechanisms of STPs from different microbial sources \nare unclear. Whole genome sequencing, transcriptome \nsequencing, and proteome sequencing of salt-tolerant \nmicroorganisms have been performed using bioinfor -\nmatics methods to understand their genome structure, \nbiosynthesis, and metabolic pathways, and to explore \nthe types of genes associated with STPs. The relationship \namong salt-tolerant microorganisms, genes involved in \nSTPs, and STPs should be clarified. Exploring the inter -\nplay between protease sequence structure, spatial con -\nformation, functional properties, and salt stress, and \nelucidating the salt tolerance mechanisms of STPs from \ndifferent microbial sources is a research focus. Visual \nanalysis and protein engineering techniques can be com -\nbined to achieve this.\nIn addition, low yield, poor stability, and limited cata -\nlytic efficiency are also issues that need to be addressed \nin the context of STPs and their application to high-salt \ntraditional fermented foods. Given the low yield of salt-\ntolerant enzymes, one important research direction is \nto use a combination of traditional microbial screening \ntechniques and modern molecular biology techniques \nto rapidly, accurately, and efficiently screen and identify Page 19 of 23\n Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \n \nmicroorganisms from more ecological environments that \ncan produce abundant STPs. Another way to address the \nproblem of low microbial enzyme production is to use \nmulti-omics techniques to mine the salt-tolerant genes of \nsalt-tolerant microorganisms in combination with high-\nefficiency heterologous expression systems to rapidly \nobtain low-cost STP products. Due to the poor stabil -\nity and limited catalytic efficiency of STPs, appropriate \nimmobilization methods or techniques can be chosen \nto construct stable and efficient immobilized STPs to \nimprove the rate of reaction between enzyme and sub -\nstrate matrix, enzyme stability, and multiplexing. In addi -\ntion, rational design and modification of STP molecules \nbased on modern biotechnology to improve enzyme \nactivity and stability is one of the future research direc -\ntions for STPs. Of course, various computer-aided tech -\nniques (such as protein database and model construction, \nbig data analysis and processing, artificial intelligence \nprediction and accurate identification) can help further \nexplore the physiological and metabolic properties of \nSTPs and salt-tolerant microorganisms to improve pro -\nduction efficiency and output quality. In the future, STPs \nwill be used more and more widely in various fields. At \nthe same time, methods to improve the properties of \nSTPs will continue to be innovated, which will lay a \nsolid foundation for their greater usefulness in practical \napplications.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are thankful for the financially support from the National Natural \nScience Foundation of China (32072205, 22138004), the first phase of the \nconnotation construction of the 14th Five-Year Plan of Tibetan medicine \n(2021ZYYGH008).\nAuthor contributions\nHY: conceptualization, resources, writing—original draft.
