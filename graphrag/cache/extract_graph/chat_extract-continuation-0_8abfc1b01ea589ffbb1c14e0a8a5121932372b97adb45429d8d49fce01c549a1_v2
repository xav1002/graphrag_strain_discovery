The above-presented statistics ofthe number of species described are all based on somemore or less arbitrary ideas of how to define a species and\nwhen to decide whether a new isolate may belong to an\nalready known species or should be described as a novelone. A recent evaluation of a large number of isolates ofHalobacteriaceae from saltern ponds in Spain and Algeria\nusing multilocus sequence analysis shows that, althoughclusters can be defined by concatenation of multiple\nmarker sequences, barriers to exchange between them are\nleaky. No nonarbitrary way to circumscribe 'species' istherefore likely to emerge for the Halobacteriaceae in the\nnear future [29].Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 5 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)Numbers of different genera and species within the family Halobacteriaceae , the family Halomonadaceae , and the order Hala- naerobiales , whose names have been validly published, 1980–2007 Figure 2\nNumbers of different genera an d species within the family Halobacteriaceae , the family Halomonadaceae , and \nthe order Halanaerobiales , whose names have been validly published, 1980–2007.\nSaline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 6 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)A dramatic increase in the number of descriptions of new\nspecies in recent years can also be observed for the second\nphylogenetic group that consists (almost) entirely of halo-philes: the family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria ).\nWhen Halomonas elongata was isolated in 1980 [30], few\npeople predicted that it would be the first representativeof a very large group of metabolically versatile moderate\nhalophiles. The recognition that Halomonas and relatives\ndeserve to be classified in a separate family came in 1988[31], and the number of species and genera has been ris-ing steadily since ([5,32,33]; Fig. 2, middle panel).Recently two new genera were added to the family, Halo-\ntalea and Modicisalibacter [34,35], bringing the census for\nMarch 2008 to 7 genera with 63 species whose names\nhave been validly published. Out of these 63 species, 60can be considered halophiles as based on the above defi-nition. The three genera Zymomonas , Carnimonas , and\nCobetia each contain presently one non-halophilic or\nmarine species. As of March 2, 2008, four new species ofthe genus Halomonas were listed as 'in press' in the Inter-\nnational Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbi-\nology.\nThe third phylogenetically coherent group consisting\nentirely of halophiles is the interesting but little studiedorder Halanaerobiales , families Halanaerobiaceae and Halo-\nbacteroidaceae (Low G+C branch of the Firmicutes ) [18].\nThis group consists of obligate anaerobes, and most liveby fermentation of sugars or (in a few cases only) aminoacids. That the study of this group has to some extent beenneglected in comparison with the other halophilebranches is obvious from the number of new species\ndescribed: the count for March 2008 was 11 genera and 24\nspecies (Fig. 2, lower panel), the two most recently addedgenera and species – Halonatronum saccharophilum and\nSelenihalanaerobacter shriftii having been described in\n2001. The latter species is of special interest as it makes aliving by anaerobic respiration rather than by fermenta-\ntion [36]. The family Halanaerobiaceae also contains a\nthermophilic representative: Halothermothrix orenii , an\norganism isolated from a hypersaline lake in Tunisia thatcombines anaerobic life at high salt (optimum 100 g/l,tolerating up to 200 g/l salt) with a high temperature opti-mum (60°C, growing up to 68°C) [37].\nMechanisms of adaptation of halophilic microorganisms \nto life at high salt\nTrüper's four 'postulates', as presented at the Alicante sym-\nposium [1], deal with the presence, distribution and bio-synthesis of organic osmotic solutes, and they mentionspecific compounds such as ectoine and glycine betaine.\nA basic property of all halophilic microorganisms is the\nfact that their cytoplasm has to be at least isoosmotic withtheir surrounding medium. Biological membranes arepermeable to water, and active energy-dependent inward\ntransport of water to compensate for water lost by osmotic\nprocesses is energetically not feasible. Moreover, cells thatkeep a turgor need even to maintain their intracellularosmotic pressure higher than that of their environment[38,39].\nThere are two fundamentally different strategies used by\nhalophilic microorganisms to balance their cytoplasmosmotically with their medium. The first involves accu-mulation of molar concentrations of potassium and chlo-ride. This strategy requires extensive adaptation of theintracellular\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like you provided two different texts, one about a scientific article on halophilic microorganisms and another text that is not related to the first one.\n\nFor the first text, I'll try to extract relevant information:\n\n**Extracted entities:**\n\n* **Halobacteriaceae**: a family of halophilic microorganisms\n* **Halomonadaceae**: a family of halophilic microorganisms\n* **Halanerobiales**: an order of halophilic microorganisms\n* **Ectoine**: a specific compound mentioned in the text as an osmotic solute\n* **Glycine betaine**: a specific compound mentioned in the text as an osmotic solute\n\n**Extracted relationships:**\n\n* The family Halobacteriaceae has 63 species, with 60 of them being halophiles.\n* The order Halanaerobiales consists of obligate anaerobes that live by fermentation or anaerobic respiration.\n\nIf you'd like me to extract more information or perform a specific task on the text, please let me know!"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
