These microbial-derived proteases possess \nadvantageous characteristics, including high efficiency, \nstability, and ease of purification. Consequently, they are \nwidely employed in various industries such as food, feed, pharmaceutical, and leather processing (Chanalia et  al. \n2011; Matkawala et al. 2021; Rao et al. 1998).\nDue to their own variability, microorganisms may be \nable to produce proteases that are adapted to different \npH values, temperatures, pressures, and other indus -\ntrial requirements (Naveed et al. 2021). In some specific \nenvironments (such as high salt), common proteases \ntend to lose their activity, which limits their applica -\ntion. Salt-tolerant proteases (STPs) are known for their \nhigh salt tolerance, and are able to withstand concentra -\ntions of approximately 3.0 M NaCl or higher (Gao et al. \n2019, 2018). They are often found in organisms adapted \nto high-salt environments. STPs are more promising \nfor industrial applications due to their higher salt tol -\nerance, wider adaptability, and more efficient catalytic \nability under extreme conditions compared to common \nproteases. In the food processing industry, STPs can be \nused in high-salt foods, such as soy sauce, curd, shrimp \npaste, and sausages (Gao et al. 2019, 2018; Naveed et al. \n2021). Their contribution lies in their ability to hydrolyze \nproteins, thereby improving the taste, flavor, and over -\nall quality of such foods. In the environmental industry, \nSTPs can help improve water quality by breaking down \ncomplex organic compounds in industrial wastewater \ninto simpler, more easily removable forms (Anh et  al. \n2021; Sivaprakasam et  al. 2011). In addition, STPs have Page 3 of 23\n Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \n \nshown potential as antifungal agents in agriculture, food \nproduction, and biotechnology (Essghaier et  al. 2009). \nThey have also been used in detergent formulations for \nthe effective removal of blood, egg, grass, and ketchup \nstains (Mokashe et al. 2017). Given their distinctive func -\ntional properties and potential commercial value, STPs \nhave attracted considerable attention from researchers.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing number \nof studies on microbial-derived STPs. These studies have \nfocused on screening or identifying novel salt-tolerant \nmicroorganisms from different ecological environments \nusing various modern techniques to uncover novel STPs \nwith superior properties (Gao et al. 2020; Nishikawa et al. \n2022; Sun et al. 2020; Takenaka et al. 2022). The catalytic \nmechanisms of STPs have been intensively studied using \nmolecular biology and protein chemistry techniques to \nreveal their unique catalytic properties in high-salt envi -\nronments (Gao et  al. 2019). Using protein modification \nand computer-aided simulation techniques, research -\ners have successfully modified protease molecules to \nenhance the salt tolerance of the enzyme itself (Senba \net al. 2023; Takenaka et al. 2022; Takita et al. 2008). Novel \nSTP preparations have been developed and are being \ntested for applications in biopharmaceuticals, food pro -\ncessing, environmental treatment, and other fields (Fu \net al. 2008; Hao et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2019). In addition, \noptimizing the growth conditions of enzyme-producing \nmicroorganisms and developing effective isolation and \npurification protocols are important research directions \nfor researchers to obtain novel STPs with potential func -\ntional value and capable of meeting industrial demands \n(Setyorini et al. 2006; Sivaprakasam et al. 2011; Vidyasa -\ngar et  al. 2007). However, despite numerous scientific \nreports on the discovery of novel STPs, improvement in \nSTP activity and yield, exploration of STP mechanisms, \nand expansion of commercial applications (An et al. 2023; \nBanerjee and Ray 2017; Karan et al. 2012; Mokashe et al. \n2018), a systematic review of microbial-derived STPs \nand their application to traditional high-salt soy-based \nfermented foods is notably absent. This comprehensive \nreview introduces the STP-producing microbial species \nand their selection methods, and summarizes and ana -\nlyzes the salt tolerance mechanisms of the microorgan -\nisms. It also presents different methods for the isolation \nand purification of STPs and discusses the mechanisms \nunderlying their salt tolerance. In addition, it highlights \nthe significant contribution of modern biotechnology in \nenhancing salt tolerance in STPs. Importantly, this review \nemphasizes the wide range of applications of STPs in \nhigh-salt traditional soybean fermented foods and offers \ninsights into the future development of microbial-derived \nSTPs. By consolidating this information, this review aims \nto provide a valuable resource for researchers to identify gaps in knowledge concerning the process of isolating\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2e0520f0ff97d5b5627fa855941b94ad8490e9b2de1251e49aabbfe937779679_v2"}
