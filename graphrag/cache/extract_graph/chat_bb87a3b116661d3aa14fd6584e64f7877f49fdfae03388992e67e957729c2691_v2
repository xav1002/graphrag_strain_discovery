Previous \nstudies have reported the purification of various STPs \nfrom A. oryzae, including salt-tolerant acid protease (Lee \net  al. 2010), salt-tolerant neutral protease (Wang et  al. \n2013), salt-tolerant alkaline protease (Gao et  al. 2019), \nand salt-tolerant aspartate aminopeptidase (Gao et  al. \n2018). The STP from A. oryzae LK-101 is relatively sta -\nble at pH 4.5–7.5, below 40 °C, and up to 10% salt con -\ncentration, which suggests that it may perform various \nfunctions in soy sauce and even fish sauce fermentation, \nespecially to improve flavor by hydrolyzing protein sub -\nstrates (Lee et al. 2010). The salt-tolerant neutral protease \nderived from A. oryzae CICIM F0899 shows robust salt \ntolerance up to 18% NaCl and significant thermal stabil -\nity under saline conditions (Wang et  al. 2013). Further -\nmore, results from a small pilot scale of 0.5 to 5.0 L using \nthe enzyme in soy sauce production have shown promise \nfor the enzyme in soy sauce production. The STP from \nA. oryzae 3.042 exhibits greater stability under high-salt \nconditions compared to non-STPs, and its presence is \nstrongly associated with soy sauce quality and raw mate -\nrial utilization (Gao et  al. 2019). Salt-tolerant aspartyl \naminopeptidase is capable of specifically releasing fresh-\nflavored glutamate and aspartic acid with low threshold \nvalues from peptides containing glutamate and aspar -\ntic acid residues at the N-terminus of soybean proteins, \nwhich plays a key role in fermented soybean products \n(Gao et al. 2018; Stressler et al. 2016). Remarkably, salt-\ntolerant aspartyl aminopeptidase from A. oryzae 3.042 \ndemonstrates excellent salt tolerance and holds great \npromise for applications in the production of soy sauce, \nsoy paste, sufu, and tempeh (Gao et al. 2018). Glutamyl \ntranspeptidase is another pivotal enzyme involved in glu -\ntamate production during high salt fermentation of soy \nsauce by A. oryzae. The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase \nderived from Aspergillus sydowii exhibits high activity \neven under high-salt conditions (Senba et al. 2023). It has \nalso been shown to increase the levels of the fresh flavor \namino acid L-glutamate in soy sauce. Immobilized B. \nsubtilis bacteria with a novel salt-tolerant L-glutaminase \nhave been applied to high-salt dilute soy sauce brew -\ning, resulting in a 45.9% increase in L-glutaminase levels \n(Zhang et al. 2022a). Collectively, these salt-tolerant pro -\nteases play a key role in soy sauce fermentation by accel -\nerating fermentation, increasing raw material utilization, \nenhancing product flavor, shortening the production \ncycle, and reducing production costs.Page 17 of 23\n Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \n \nApplication in soy paste fermentation\nSoy paste generally refers to one of the condiments made \nfrom soybeans, broad beans, and other bean bases mixed \nwith salt water and spices in a certain container after a \nlong fermentation. Its name varies across regions: Daji -\nang in Northeast China, Doenjang in South Korea, and \nmiso in Japan (Chun et al. 2020; Yue et al. 2021). Like soy \nsauce, soy paste undergoes a long fermentation period of \n2–6  months. During the fermentation phase, enzymes \nproduced by microbial growth and reproduction are used \nto break down proteins, starches, and other components \nin the raw material. These transformations produce pep -\ntides, free amino acids, and sugars, resulting in the dis -\ntinctive flavor and color of soy paste (Zhou et al. 2021).\nAspergillus  species, especially A. oryzae, are the main \nmicroorganisms used in soy paste fermentation, produc -\ning a variety of STPs (Ao et  al. 2018). Currently, many \nstrategies such as the selection of excellent enzyme-\nproducing microorganisms and the co-fermentation of \nmultiple strains have been employed to expedite the fer -\nmentation cycle, reduce production costs and enhance \nthe flavor profile of soy paste. By subjecting A. sojae to \nsuccessive mutagenesis using several conventional muta -\ngenic breeding methods, the mutant EUN13 has been \nobtained, exhibiting a 3.8-fold increase in STP yield \ncompared to the parent strain (Lim et al. 2019). Co-cul -\ntivation of A. oryzae QM-6 with A. niger QH-3 has been \nshown to enhance\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bb87a3b116661d3aa14fd6584e64f7877f49fdfae03388992e67e957729c2691_v2"}
