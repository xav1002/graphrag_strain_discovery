Resuming growth under stress conditions is risky because\ngrowth inhibition by stress physiology is actually an energy trade-\noff with tolerance [16]. Nevertheless, microbes have multiple\neffects on plant ion and osmotic balance, ROS regulation and\ndetoxiﬁcation, and photosynthesis. These processes are interre-\nlated and ultimately promote plant growth under salt stress via\nthree mechanisms: re-establishing ion and osmotic homeostasis,\npreventing damage to plant cells, and resuming plant growth\nunder salt stress ( Fig. 1 ).\n3.1. Re-establishing ion and osmotic homeostasis\n3.1.1. Ion balance\nThe accumulation of Na+in the plant cytoplasm is toxic to plant\ncells. Na+competes with other ions to bind proteins, which leads to\nthe inactivation of enzymes. Na+also inhibits the uptake of K+and\nother ions due to the impact of ion balance between the two sides\nof the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, the accumulation of Na+\nin the cytoplasm must be reduced, and the ion balance must be re-\nestablished for roots to acquire other ions.\nTo counter the high Na+concentration in the environment,\nplants need to reduce Na+inﬂux through the plasma membrane,\nwhich is mediated by the high-afﬁnity K+channel (HKT)\n[78,78,79] . Many microbial strains have been shown to increase\nplant shoot and/or root K+/Na+ratios by increasing K+and/or\nreducing Na+in the cytoplasm, but the underlying mechanisms\nvary. HKT1, which plays critical roles in both Na+inﬂux across\nthe plasma membrane and long-distance Na+transport, is consid-\nered a key determinant of plant salt tolerance [79]. Expression of\nHKT1 in shoots promotes plant salt tolerance by reducing Na+\naccumulation in shoots [80]. The speciﬁc role of HKT1 in the\ndecrease in microbe-mediated plant Na+under salt stress has been\nrecognized. For example, Zhang et al. [81] demonstrated that B.\nsubtilis GB03 stimulated HKT1 expression in shoots while reducing\nit in roots under 100 mM NaCl by producing VOCs. Athkt1 ;1, but\nnotsos3, mutant plants failed to show GB03-induced plant growth\nand a decrease in Na+under salt stress [81]. Niu et al. [82] demon-Y. Liu, W. Xun, L. Chen et al. Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 20 (2022) 6543–6551\n6545strated that enhanced Puccinellia tenuiﬂora salt tolerance is depen-\ndent on modulating the expression of HKT1 . In contrast, Pseu-\ndomonas simiae AU decreased the expression of HKT1 in soybean\nshoots under salt stress [73].P. indica colonized Arabidopsis roots\nunder salt stress and showed enhanced expression of HKT1 [83].\nInoculation with AMF signiﬁcantly induced HKT1;1 and HKT1;6\nin both the roots and shoots of lettuce under 60 mM NaCl, but in\nthe same study, inoculation with another AMF strain, Claroideoglo-\nmus lamellosum , did not signiﬁcantly change the expression pro-\nﬁles for HKT1;1 and HKT1;6 in lettuce [84].\nThe excess Na+in the cytoplasm under salt stress can be either\nexported out of the protoplast by the plasma membrane Na+/H+\nantiporter [17] or compartmentalized into the vacuole by the vac-\nuolar Na+/H+exchanger (NHX) [85]. Increasing the Na+efﬂux by\nthe SOS pathway and vacuolar NHX-driven vacuolar Na+compart-\nmentalization is another strategy for reducing cytoplasmic Na+\naccumulation [86]. SOS1, a plasma membrane Na+/H+antiporter\ncontrolled by the regulation cascade of SOS2 and SOS3, is believed\nto be a key determinant of Na+exclusion in roots [17]. Chen et al.[87,88] showed that B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 strongly stimulated\nthe expression of NHX1 ,NHX2 and NHX3 in maize under salt stress\nby producing spermidine. However, either mutation of NHX1 or\nblocking the SOS pathway, but not mutation with HKT1 , leads to\ndeﬁciency in SQR9- and spermidine-induced salt tolerance, indi-\ncating the determinant role of NHX1 and SOS1 in SQR9-induced\nsalt tolerance [88]. Baek et al. [89] demonstrated a similar conclu-\nsion that the SOS pathway is necessary for B. oryzicola YC7007-\ninduced Arabidopsis tolerance to salt stress. There are also some\ncases in which microbial inoculation increases K+uptake but has\nno effect on Na+accumulation [54].\n3.1.2. Osmotic balance\nSoil salinity is always accompanied by hyperosmotic stress in\nplants. A high salt concentration is hyperosmotic to plant cells\nand will affect root water absorption or even water loss. This situ-\nation also limits the uptake of nutrients by roots and results in ABA\naccumulation.
