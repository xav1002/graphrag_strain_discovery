High-purity proteases can be \nobtained using these methods or by combining them \nappropriately. Two alkaline proteases of Haloalkaliphi -\nlic bacterium D-15–9 and Oceanobacillus onchorynchii \nMi-10-54, purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation \nand hydrophobic interaction chromatography, have a \ncertain salt tolerance and temperature tolerance, and \nthe latter is more thermostable (Raval et  al. 2022). The \nhalophilic protease Pph_Pro1, cloned from Pseudoaltero -\nmonas phenolica, has been purified by an osmotic shock \nprocedure and immobilized metal affinity chromatog -\nraphy (Johnson et  al. 2018). The purified enzyme has \nan activity of 0.44 U/mg and exhibits halophilic, alkalo -\nphilic, and thermally stable properties. An extracellular \nprotease HlyA from the extremely halophilic archaeon \nHalococcus salifodinae has been isolated and purified by \naffinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatog -\nraphy (Hou et  al. 2021). Its activity is best at 45  °C, pH \n9.0, and 1.5–2 M NaCl. It retains the maximum activity \nof > 75% at a wide range of NaCl concentrations from 0.5 \nto 4.0 M. With the development of science and technol -\nogy, label-assisted protein purification technology has \ngradually become the preferred method for scientific research and large-scale industrial demand (Gomari et al. \n2020). Employing fusion proteins can help to save time \nand cost, and they can help to achieve high-throughput \npurification of the protein. In practice, high-purity STPs \nare important due to their high stability and efficiency, \nthus improving the effectiveness of their applications. \nTherefore, the isolation and purification\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8163fd439249921522e29a562fa9a3c0cacebaaa7b851f84cca666166746e067_v2"}
