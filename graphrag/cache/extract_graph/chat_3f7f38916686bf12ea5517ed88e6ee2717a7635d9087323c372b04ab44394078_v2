Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \nagarilyticus  GUGFAWS-3, isolated from a marine white \nsponge, can produce two halo-extremozymes: pro -\ntease and lipase. The optimal activity of the protease is \npH 7.0, 70  °C, and 3  M NaCl. Notably, this represents \nthe first report of halophilic neutral protease produc -\ntion within the Halococcus genus (Gaonkar and Furtado \n2020). Although the production of STPs in archaea has \nbeen less extensively studied than in other microorgan -\nisms, the investigation of extracellular proteases in salt-\ntolerant archaea holds great potential to expand the field \nof protease applications and contribute to the exploration \nof novel STPs.\nScreening methods for microorganisms producing STPs\nTraditional methods for selecting STP-producing micro -\norganisms rely primarily on the specific microbial pro -\nduction environment. These environments include highly \nsaline habitats such as oceans, salt lakes, salt farms, saline \nsoils, and salt-containing foods. Isolation of salt-toler -\nant microorganisms from these environments requires \nmany steps such as sample collection, isolation of strains, \nmorphological characteristics and molecular sequence \nidentification of strains (Abanoz et  al. 2017). To obtain \nexcellent STP-producing strains, additional steps such as \noptimizing enzyme production conditions and evaluating \nthe enzyme production capacity of the microorganism \nbased on the enzyme activity index have been imple -\nmented (Wahab and Ahmed 2018; Zhang et  al. 2023). \nWhile microorganisms obtained through conventional \nscreening methods exhibit high salt tolerance and sta -\nble enzyme production capacity, limitations such as low \nscreening efficiency and time consumption may restrict \ntheir widespread application.\nIn order to obtain organisms with enhanced pro -\ntease production capacity, various methods have been \nemployed to screen for strains exhibiting high levels \nof STP production, including UV mutagenesis, chemi -\ncal reagent mutagenesis, room-temperature plasma \nmutagenesis, and genetic engineering. For example, by \nmutagenesis of A. oryzae 3.042 at room temperature \nand atmospheric pressure, a mutant strain, designated \nH8, has been obtained with significant activity of neu -\ntral protease, alkaline protease, and aspartyl aminopepti -\ndase (Gao et  al. 2020). The incorporation of this strain \nin soy sauce fermentation processes has led to signifi -\ncant improvements in peptide and amino acid content. \nThe serine protease gene isp  from Bacillus  sp.  LCB10 \nhas been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using \ngenetic engineering techniques. The resulting serine \nprotease demonstrates high tolerance to NaCl, exhib -\niting stable activity in the presence of 1–5% NaCl and \nretaining 86% of its activity in the presence of 7% NaCl \n(Hou et  al. 2019). Additionally, the gene encoding the extracellular protease, sptA, has been cloned from the \nhalophilic archaeon Natrinema sp. J7 and successfully \nexpressed in Haloferax volcanii WFD11 (Shi et al. 2006). \nThe resultant recombinant enzyme exhibits remark -\nable stability, retaining activity even in the presence of \n2.5  M NaCl at 50  °C and pH 8.0. While these methods \nsignificantly enhance the likelihood of attaining excellent \nprotease-producing strains, certain challenges such as \nscreening limitations and demanding technical require -\nments are also encountered. Screening processes rely -\ning on wild-type strains may suffer from screening blind \nspots and involve high workloads.\nIn nature, microorganisms are categorized as either \nculturable and unculturable, especially those living in \nextreme environments, which may produce STPs with \nspecial structures and functions (Wang et al. 2021a). To \nincrease the likelihood of discovering novel secondary \nmetabolites even from unculturable microorganisms, \nmetagenomics is employed to analyze the functional \npotential of DNA extracted from environmental samples. \nFor instance, a metagenomic library has been constructed \nfrom the DNA of the Chumathang hot spring sediment, \nleading to the identification of heat-resistant, basophilic, \nand oxidative-stable serine proteases (Singh et al. 2015). \nUsing a metagenomic screening approach, another serine \nprotease gene has been cloned from a saline habitat and \nis active in saline conditions (Purohit and Singh 2013). \nA novel thermostable serine protease has been obtained \nfrom a metagenomic library derived from marine sedi -\nments in the East China Sea, which not only shows good \nthermal activity and stability, but also has strong salt tol -\nerance (40% residual activity when kept in 3  M NaCl) \n(Sun et  al. 2020). With the advancement of bioinfor -\nmatics, there has been a growing number of studies on \nintegrated metagenomic approaches such as metagen -\nomics and metaproteomics to assist in the screening of \nSTP-producing microorganisms (Busche et al. 2018; Gar -\ncia-Moyano et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022).
