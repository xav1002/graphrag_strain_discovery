Besides, the COD removal rate decreased from 88% to\n54%. As previous reports ( Yogalakshmi and Joseph, 2010; Zhao et al.,\n2016 ), the increase of salinity inhibited the microbial metabolism,\nthereby reduced the degradation ability of SAGS.\nPhase III (elevated salt concentration): However, the salt stress in-\ncreasing from 7% to 9% salinity had little in ﬂuence on the removal of\nCOD, the system could maintain about 50% removal rate. In this period,the MLSS and MLVSS continuously increased to 6.36 and 5.82 g L\n−1\nrespectively, the SVI had no obvious ﬂuctuation and maintained at\nabout 54 mL g−1. The SAGS was observed to dominate in SBR system at\n7–9% salinity.\n3.2. Bacterial community analysis\nThe high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore\nthe microbial community structure and characteristics of SAGS re-\nsponding to hypersaline stress. The activated sludge were collected at\n0%, 3%, 6%, 8% and 9% salt concentrations to characterize the mi-\ncrobial community, which were labeled as 0, 3, 6, 8 and 9, respectively.\nAll samples were collected at the same operation conditions to reduce\noperating errors.\nA total of 175,162 e ﬀective reads (36,697, 31,450, 31,843, 40,789\nand 34,383 for 0%, 3%, 6%, 8% and 9%, respectively) were obtained by\nthe MiSeq pyrosequencing from sludge samples at di ﬀerent salt con-\ncentration. Each sample was then normalized to 31,450 sequences, thenconducted the downstream analyses to obtain 115(0%), 96(3%),\n82(6%), 66(8%) and 54(9%) operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at\n97% similarity threshold. Rarefaction curve ( Fig. 2) was employed to\nstandardize and compare the observed taxon richness among 6 samplesand to verify the representativeness of collected samples ( He et al.,\n2016 ). As shown in Fig. 2, all curves tended to be ﬂat as sequence\nnumbers increased, indicating that the sequence volume was reasonableto represent almost microbial community of six sludge samples. This\ncould be also con ﬁrmed by the high coverage ( Table 2).\nIn addition, the community richness was characterized by Chao\nvalues and abundance-based coverage estimation (ACE). The results\nshowed that 0% sample had the highest species richness. With theincrease of salt concentration, the species richness decreased obviously.\nIt may be related to the selection pressure of high salinity, some bac-\nteria were not suitable for high salt conditions, causing the reduction of\ncommunity richness. Moreover, the Shannon and Simpson values were\nused to evaluate the community diversity ( Li et al., 2016 ). Results\nshowed that the 6% sample had the highest diversity, afterward, thediversity decreased sharply. The 6% salt concentration seemed to be a\nthreshold for microbial diversity, which increased at 0 –6% salinities,\nwhile decreased due to the higher salt concentration at 7 –9% salinities.\nVenn diagram depicted ( Fig. 3) that only 6.05% of total OTUs were\nthe shared OUTs among the six sludge samples, so that the variation ofmicrobial structure happened along with elevated salinities. Some\nbacteria adapting to high salinity grew well and gradually pre-\ndominated in the SBR system, while others without salt-tolerance ca-\npacity were gradually washed out or weakened with increasing salinity.\nBesides, the prosperity of some halophilic bacteria changed the di-\nversity and richness of microbial community. In addition, the shared\nOTUs between adjacent samples 0% and 3%, 3% and 6%, 6% and 8%,\n8% and 9% were 23.92%, 31.46%, 31.76% and 38.33%, respectively,\nindicating samples from closer salt concentration had more similarities\nin the microbial community composition, and the succession of the\nmicrobial community was a gradual process.\nFig. 1.

Dynamics and functional groups of the microbial community\nThe gene taxonomic analysis for six di ﬀerent salinity samples as-\nsigned to phylum, class and genus taxa levels were summarized at\nFig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4a, the phylum Proteobacteria predominated in\nthe whole operating process, which was similar to other microbialcommunity from di ﬀerent environment areas, such as soil ( Roesch\net al., 2007) and sewage ( Zhang et al., 2012). The second most domi-\nnant phylum was Firmicutes in six sludge samples. Moreover, the re-\nlative abundance of these two phyla was over 98%, and the Proteo-\nbacteria maintained over 80% abundance in all sludge samples\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you have provided a scientific article about the effects of salinity on microbial communities in wastewater treatment systems.
