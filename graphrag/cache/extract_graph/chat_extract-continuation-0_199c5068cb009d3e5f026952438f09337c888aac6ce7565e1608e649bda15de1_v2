The experimental results of COD removal at 8%\nand 10% saline concentration further suggested that\nE.homiense employed in this study could be a moderately\nhalophillic strain. In CETPs, average salt concentration of\ntannery wastewater had been found to vary between 2%\nand 6% and this covered salt tolerant regime only. The salt\nconcentration hardly exceeded 8% (w/v) for effluent\nreleased from beam house operations of leather process-\ning units and the identified mixed consortia reported in\nthis study could be advantageously employed for efficient\nbiological treatment of the saline waste stream. It could be\nobserved from Fig(s) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, that the treatment of tan-\nnery saline wastewater by natural habitat strains (blank)\nwas not a feasible option. Efficiency of COD removal was\nobserved to be less than 50% for different saline concen-\ntrations viz., 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% (w/v). From Fig(s)\n2, 3, 4, 5, it could be observed that the conventional acti-\nvated tannery sludge showed a low COD removal com-\npared to the salt tolerant consortia. (Fig. 6 describes the\ncomparative profile of % COD removal by activated\nsludge (tannery) and salt tolerant consortia). From Fig. 6,\nit could be observed that as the salinity increased from 2\nto 4% (w/v), tannery sludge efficiency reduced to 60%\nfrom 80%; it reduced further to 45% for 6% (w/v) saline\nvalue. The COD removal results for tannery saline waste\nstream by natural habitat strains as well as activated tan-\nnery sludge proved they were not suitable and that spe-\ncialized consortia (salt tolerant) were needed for efficient\ntreatment. Our experimental findings supported the view\nthat the identified salt tolerant bacterial consortia be con-sidered as a suitable working culture for efficient biodeg-\nradation of tannery saline wastewater.\nConclusion\nSalt tolerant bacterial strains ( P.aeruginosa, B.flexus,\nE.homiense and S.aureus ) were isolated and identified from\nmarine sources and tannery saline wastewater. Growth\nfactors (media, inoculum conc., salinity, pH, temperature\nand agitation rate) were optimized for identified strains in\nbatch experiments. Commercial tannery saline wastewa-\nter was characterized and biologically treated with both\nmono and mixed halotolerant bacterial isolates.
