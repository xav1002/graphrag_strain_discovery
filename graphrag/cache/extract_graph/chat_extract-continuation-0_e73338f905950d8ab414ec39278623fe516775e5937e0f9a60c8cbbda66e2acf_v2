Under normal conditions, ROS production and\nelimination are balanced; however, salt stress causes an imbalance\ndue to the increase in ROS [102] . It is widely reported that plant\nelectrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation, as signatures of plasma\nmembrane impairment by ROS [102] , could be reduced by\nmicrobes.\n3.2.1. Reducing ROS generation. Inoculation with microbes that\nreduce ROS generation may exert beneﬁcial effects in preventing\nor arresting oxidative damage. ROS are produced from two\nsources: metabolic ROS are mainly produced in the chloroplast,\nmitochondria and peroxisome via different pathways, and signal-ing ROS are produced in the apoplast by NADPH oxidases [104] .\nUnder salt stress, there is a decrease in transpiration rates, which\nreduces CO 2availability to the plants. Salt stress also exposes\nchloroplasts to high excitation energy, which causes ROS genera-\ntion [105] . It is evident that microbial inoculation is capable of\nstimulating stomatal conductance and increasing the CO 2avail-\nability of plants under saline conditions. In particular, increasing\nchlorophyll and carotenoid contents in salt-stressed plants is a\ncommon feature of microbe-primed plant salt tolerance\n(Table S1 ). Native AMF-inoculated maize showed higher efﬁcien-\ncies of photosystem II and stomatal conductance, which are\nbelieved to decrease photorespiration and ROS production\n[106,107] . Sulfur metabolism is connected to photosynthesis due\nto its role in forming iron-sulfur cluster proteins, which act as elec-\ntron carriers in photosynthesis. Andres-Barrao et al. [108] found\nthat Enterobacter sp. SA187 suppressed Arabidopsis salt stress-\ninduced ROS accumulation in plastids by increasing root sulfur\nassimilation. Inoculation with SA187 also rescued the hypersensi-\ntivity of Arabidopsis LSU mutants, in which four genes encoding\nchloroplast-targeted proteins (LSU1-LSU4) that activate Fe-\nsuperoxide dismutase were silenced [108] .\n3.2.2. Scavenging excess ROS. In addition to reducing plant ROS gen-\neration, microbes can stimulate the ROS detoxiﬁcation system in\nplants. Both the enzymatic antioxidant system, including superox-\nide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX), and the\nnonenzymatic system, including ascorbic acid, glutathione (GSH)\nand proline, are induced when plants are under salt stress; micro-\nbial inoculation can strengthen this induction process and stimu-\nlate plants to scavenge excess ROS. For example, Waller et al.\n[43] found that P. indica -infested roots under saline conditions\nincreased the dehydroascorbate reductase activity and ascorbate\ncontent and decreased the level of dehydroascorbate. The critical\nrole of stimulating plant ROS scavenging is conﬁrmed by the fact\nthat the salt tolerance induced by B. velezensis and the produced\nspermidine is dependent on plant GSH production [88]. It is evi-\ndent that Pseudomonas -produced phenazine also contributes to\ncatalase induction and thus ROS scavenging in plants under saline\nstress [69]. Moreover, some genes involved in Fe acquisition were\nactivated in Bacillus licheniformis SA03-inoculated plants under salt\nstress [93]. Considering the Fenton reaction between iron and H 2O2\nthat generates hydroxyl radicals [104] , the modulation of iron\nhomeostasis in plant cells by microbial inoculants may also con-\ntribute to the avoidance of hydroxyl radicals causing cell damage\nand subsequent cell death.\nIn contrast, several microbes with high antioxidant activity\nattenuated the salt stress-induced antioxidant system. For exam-\nple, inoculation with Brevibacterium linens RS16 was found to\nreduce the salt stress-induced plant emissions of all major classes\nof volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which serve as antioxidants\nto tolerate stress [109] . An endophytic isolate of the fungus Yar-\nrowia lipolytica selected on the basis of high antioxidant activity\nhas reduced the peroxidase and catalase activity levels of maize\nin saline conditions compared to noninoculated maize [97]. These\nexamples suggest that microbes can also enhance the salt toler-\nance of plants by directly scavenging ROS, which results in a reduc-\ntion in stress-induced antioxidant production in plants.\n3.3. Resuming plant growth under salt stress\nTransporting ions, producing osmolytes and scavenging ROS, as\ndiscussed above, are all energy-consuming processes. For plants\nunder salt-stressed conditions, resuming growth is a difﬁcult\nchoice for energy distribution and is precisely controlled by a very\ncomplex signaling transduction network.Y. Liu, W.
