Up-regulation or \nexpression of genes encoding STPs can improve the salt \ntolerance of cells and prevent the cells from being killed \nby salt. A salt stress-responsive cysteine protease gene \nfrom Salix matsudana has been cloned and expressed \nin E. coli, which leads to the enhancement of salt toler -\nance in E. coli (Zheng et al. 2018). By comparing the ser -\nine protease genes of the halotolerant cyanobacterium \nHalothece sp. PCC7418 and the freshwater cyanobac -\nterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, it has been \nshown that several serine protease genes of the halotol -\nerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC7418 were dras -\ntically up-regulated under salt with high concentration \nbut remained unchanged under salt with low concentra -\ntion (Patipong et al. 2021). These results suggest that the \ngenes encoding STPs may be associated with salt toler -\nance in microorganisms.\nThe adaptation strategy of salt on cell surfaces has also \nbeen suggested as one of the reasons for microbial salt \ntolerance (Mokashe et al. 2018). It has been shown that \nthe fraction of anionic phospholipids in the cell mem -\nbrane of halophilic bacteria gradually increases with \nhigher salinity levels, resulting in an additional mem -\nbrane surface charge that helps to maintain the hydra -\ntion state of the plasma membrane (Mokashe et al. 2018). \nCompared with the changes in cell membrane composi -\ntion of yeast tolerant to low and high salt concentrations, \nit has been found that changes in the composition of sat -\nurated and unsaturated fatty acids in highly salt-tolerant \nyeast lead to a decrease in membrane permeability and \nmobility, which may contribute to salt tolerance (Qi et al. \n2014). Glycerol is commonly used as a microbial protec -\ntion agent. Under high salt stress, engineered yeast can \nproduce abundant glycerol and secrete it extracellularly. \nThe production of microbial extracellular polysaccha -\nrides (EPS) can modify the physical and chemical prop -\nerties of the membrane, including surface charge and \nhydrophobicity, facilitating the active transport and diffu -\nsion of microorganisms and ultimately enhancing salt tol -\nerance. Current stimulation can promote the production \nof low molecular weight EPS, which is beneficial for the \nsalt tolerance of microorganisms (Feng et al. 2022). Strain \nJZ-GX1 can improve its salt tolerance by secreting large \namounts of EPS, which was secreted at 6983.9 mg/L at a \nhigh salt concentration of 60% (Li et al. 2021a). Further -\nmore, the addition of exogenous factors such as betaine \n(Hu et al. 2020a), acyl homoserine lactone (Li et al. 2019), \nand signal molecule autoinducer-2 (Gu et  al. 2021) has Page 9 of 23\n Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \n \nbeen demonstrated to stimulate EPS production and bio -\nfilm formation, promoting salt tolerance in cells.\nThe salt-in strategy is one of the salt-tolerant strategies \nof microorganisms. This is a process in which inorganic \nsalts (such as sodium and potassium ions) accumulate in \nthe cytoplasmic fluid and involves the entry and exit of \nmetal cations/H+ into the cell through membrane pro -\nteins (Mokashe et al. 2018). Salt-tolerant microorganisms \ncan respond to salt stress by up-regulating the  Na+/H+ \nantiporter subunit mnhA-G (Zeng et al. 2022). The  Na+/\nH+ antiporter plays an important role in maintaining cel -\nlular pH and cation homeostasis. Microorganisms can \nexpel excess  Na+ from cells driven by ATP (Edbeib et al. \n2016). Several anti-transporter genes have been reported \n(Fujisawa et al. 2005). A CPD photolytic gene, PnPHR1, \nhas been isolated from the Antarctic moss, Pohlia nutans \n(Wang et  al. 2021b). The gene enhances the salt toler -\nance of the microbe by increasing the expression of a \nhigh-affinity potassium transporter gene and a tono -\nplast-bound  Na+/H+ antiporter. In addition, salt-tolerant \nmicroorganisms can temporarily increase their cytoplas -\nmic  K+ content and accumulate osmotic fluid as a more \npersistent stress response to prevent water loss and sur -\nvive osmotic and ionic stress (Zheng et al. 2021). Most  K+ \ntransporters are unidirectional, and osmotic protection \nof  K+ entry into cells can only be achieved by balancing \nthe negative charge of other small molecules (Lefebvre \nand Moletta 2006). Several systems for maintaining  K+ \nhomeostasis in cells have been reported. These systems, \nwhich maintain cell stability, play different roles in differ -\nent media and transport processes of  K+ concentration \n(Lefebvre and Molet\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the input text is a scientific article about microbial salt tolerance.
