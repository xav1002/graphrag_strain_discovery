These acidic amino \nacids account for up to 20–23% of individual proteins and \nplay an important role in the salt stability of proteases \n(Karan et al. 2012). It has been observed that modifying \nthe amino acid composition on the protein surface can \nalter the salt dependence of a protein, facilitating cross-\nover between salt-tolerant and non-salt-tolerant proteins \n(Tadeo et al. 2009).\nHydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids on the pro -\ntein surface also affect the salt-adapted stability of STPs. \nHydrophilic proteins have a lower abundance of hydro -\nphobic side chains on their surface compared to non-\nhydrophilic proteins (Karan et  al. 2012). The increase \nin the number of hydrophilic amino acids compared to \nhydrophobic amino acids on the protein surface is ben -\neficial for the stability of STPs (Mokashe et  al. 2018). \nA possible explanation for this observation is that the \nreduction in hydrophobic amino acid content and the \ncorresponding increase in hydrophilic amino acid con -\ntent facilitates the binding of metal ions to the protease \nsurface charges, forming hydration shells or networks. \nAdditionally, smaller hydrophobic amino acids such as \nglycine, alanine, and valine show an adaptive mechanism \nin halophilic enzymes, in contrast to larger hydrophobic \ncounterparts (Mokashe et al. 2018).\nThe salt adaptation of STPs is influenced by the nega -\ntive charge on the surface or localized surface of the \nSTPs. For the most part, the effect of salt on protein sta -\nbility is independent of the total charge of the protein \n(Karan et al. 2012). The highly negatively charged surface \nof proteases is a molecular marker of salt adaptation (Hu \net al. 2022). The formation of negative charge on the sur -\nface of these enzymes is mainly due to the presence of \nnegatively charged amino acids on the surface (Promchai \net al. 2018). It has been suggested that the highly negative \nsurface charge of halophilic proteins makes them more \nsoluble and flexible at high salt concentrations, whereas \nnon-halophilic proteins tend to aggregate and harden \nunder these conditions (Ortega et  al. 2011). In fact, the \nnegative charge is shielded by more salt, which further \nprevents the expansion of the protein and maintains the \nsolubility of the protein. Effective hydration and pro -\nduction of ion-pair networks stabilize the structure and \nactivity of enzymes (Mokashe et al. 2018; Promchai et al. \n2018). This result has also been confirmed for halophilic \nalpha-amylase (Hu et  al. 2022). These suggest that salt \ntolerance can be improved by modifying the local charge \non the protein surface (Takenaka et al. 2022).Page 14 of 23 Yao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:82 \nThe formation of salt bridges also contributes to the salt \ntolerance of STPs. The salt bridge refers to the ionic bond \nbetween two amino acid residues with opposite charges. \nIn high-salinity environments, the polar groups of pro -\ntein molecules bind to ions to form salt bridges, which \nnot only play an important role in protein folding, struc -\nture and oligomerization, but also enhance the stability \nof protein molecules (Dym et al. 1995). By comparing the \nhalophilic malate dehydrogenase with its non-halophilic \nhomologue in the archaea Haloarcula marismortui, \nresearchers have found that the halophilic enzyme con -\ntains more salt bridges and has a higher concentration of \nsurface acidic residues. This difference may explain why \nthe halophilic enzyme is more tolerant to salt (Dym et al. \n1995). Molecular dynamics simulations of endoglucanase \nfrom A. niger have revealed the formation of salt bridges \nbetween charged residues and  Na+ and  Cl− ions. These \nsalt bridges affect the activity of the loop and the stability \nof the pocket, thus giving the enzyme salt tolerance and \nstrong thermal stability in high-salt environments (Cai \net  al. 2022). Salt bridges can also form between acidic \nresidues and specific alkaline residues on the hydration \nsurface, which enhance the ’rigidity’ of the enzyme at \nhigh salinity and protect the enzyme from salt ions (Oren \nand Mana 2002).\nInternal hydrophobic amino acids of STPs are also \nrelated to their own salt adaptability. Studies have shown \nthat the hydrophobicity of internal amino acid residues of \nproteins is strongly related to the stability of the internal \nstructure (Gromiha et  al. 1999).
