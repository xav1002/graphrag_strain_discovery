GSD2 were grown in a nutrient \nbroth containing 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% & 10% of NaCl. Cont rol tubes were served without addition of NaCl. 0.1  ml of \nfresh culture (O.D near about 1.000 at 660nm) was i noculated in medium. O.D was measured of the sample  at \n660nm with (UV-1800, SHIMADZU) at duration of 1h fo r 33h. \n \nExtracellular enzyme production at different salt c oncentration \nAmylase production:  Amylase production was analyzed by starch hydrolyz ing method.  Starch agar plate was \nprepared containing 4% and 8% NaCl. Organisms were inoculated on starch agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for \n24h. Amylase production was detected as a colorless  zone on surrounding of colony on addition of iodin e.  \n \nProteolysis production:  Skim milk agar plates were prepared containing 4% and 8% NaCl, organisms were \ninoculated. Dissolved casein surrounding the colony  resulted on secretion of protease enzyme. \n \nLipase production:  Nutrient agar plates containing vegetable oil prep ared to study extracellular lipase activity. Test \norganisms were inoculated and incubated for 24h at 37°C. Addition of CuSO 4 in plates on next day develops bluish \ngreen appearance surrounding the colony, confirms t he hydrolysis of fat in glycerol & fatty acid. \n \nRESULTS \n \nSoil Analysis:  Soil analysis data showed in (Table 1) confirms qu ality as on agricultural soil. \n \nTable 1 Analysis for different physicochemical para meter of soil \n \nSample E.C. mS/M pH % Nitrogen P 2O5 Kg/ha K 2O Kg/ha \nB 0.62 8.7  0.38  28  400 \n \nBacterial Identification, Screening and Biochemical  test: Gram staining revealed Exiguobacterium  sp. as a \ngrampositive aerobic microorganism with orange, non transparent, circular colony characteristic grown o n N-agar \nafter48h of incubation. Exiguobacterium sp. exhibited negative test for indole production, citr ate utilization, \nammonia and urea reduction as well as acid producti on, whereas nitrate reduction and carbohydrate ferm entation \nwas found to be positive (Table 2). However, the ot her strain ( Serratia sp.) is gram negative aerobic bacteria \nexhibiting off-white, non-transparent and irregular  shape colony. Biochemical test for Serratia sp. showed negative \nindole production, ammonia and urea reduction as we ll as acid production test, whereas citrate utiliza tion and \ncarbohydrate fermentation result confirmed positive  test (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2 Biochemical Characterization \n \nTests Exiguobacterium  sp.

Alignment positions  with gaps were excluded from the calculations (Fig ure 1 & 2). \nPhylogenetic tree showed the position of Exiguobacterium  GSD1 and  Serratia sp. GSD2 with respect to other \nGenBank 16S rDNA sequences. The tree was constructe d by Neighbor joining method and minimum possibilit y \nwith alignment of 812 and 1172 base pairs, with boo tstrap support values greater than 90% and 95% (Fig ure 1 & 2).
