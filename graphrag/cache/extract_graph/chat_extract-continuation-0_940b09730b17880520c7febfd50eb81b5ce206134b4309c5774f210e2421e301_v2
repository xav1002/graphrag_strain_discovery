In the present study, n ew experimental approach was proposed to prove adap tation \nability in extreme conditions with growth and devel opment of agricultural soil bacterial species in st epwise \nadaptation in high salt (NaCl) conditions. Six diff erent bacterial species were isolated from agricult ural soil \nsurrounding the Rajkot region. Out of six isolates,  two showed salt tolerance up to 10% NaCl concentra tion. \nBiochemical and molecular (16S rDNA sequencing) cha racterization revealed the strains to be Exiguobact erium sp. \nand Serratia sp.  designated as  GSD1 and GSD 2 str ains. Species were able to adapt upto 10% of NaCl i n nutrient \nbroth growth medium. Primary screening for extracel lular enzymes (protease, amylase, lipase) secretion  unveiled \nactivity of enzymes in nutrient agar plates contain ing skim milk or starch or mineral oil for protease , amylase and \nlipase production respectively. This experiment pro vides the base to link the adaptation capabilities of agricultural \nsoil microorganisms in high salty environment and v ice a versa.  \n \nKeywords: Exiguobacterium , Serratia, Salt Adaptation, Extracellular enzymes  \n___________________________________________________ __________________________________________ \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nAdaptation is an evolutionary process through which  living organisms develop to live in its changed ha bitats. Lower \nto higher living organisms are influenced but devel oped to adjust with different abiotic stresses i.e.  changes in \nsalinity of soil and water, temperature, pH, atmosp heric humidity, air circulation and radiation [1,2] .  Amongst these \nall soil and water salinity is the major stress imp acts on life, and it becomes more prominent with ti me.  \n \nGlobal warming is the key issue of current world en vironmental problems, its main emphasis on level an d surface \ntemperature of sea. The scientific committee on Ant arctic research proposed a rise in mean sea level o f up to 1.4 m \nby 2100 century and other scientists anticipated se a level rise of one to several meters[3-5] in the s ame phase. \nReports  year[6].Gujarat has 1663 km, coastal regio n and rise in 0.5 meter sea level can cover roughly  8452.971 \nKm2 land nearby coastal area[6]. This can be even more  anti-agricultural if sea level rises about 0.5 to 1.4 meters[7]. Gaurav S. Dave  et al Euro. J. Exp.

Recently, stro ked tsunamis in South Asia has affected 11,000 Ha a gricultural \nland [8], with 4067 Ha cropped area and 2260 km of coastal area in India alone[9].  Tsunami contaminat ed the \nagricultural soil with salts of Kerala, Andhra Prad esh, Tamilnadu and Pondicherry states of India. In future, natural \ndisasters like tsunami if strike in Gujarat it may contaminate the agricultural soil of Rajkot, Jamnag ar, Junagadh, \nPorbandar, Surat and Kutch districts and it will af fects the microorganisms population in agricultural  soil. In future \nhigh salt contaminated soil, either it will lose so me of the microorganismsâ€™ species or microorganisms  have to adapt \nto salty soil. \n \nIn view of this, we have focused on microorganisms of non-saline soil to adapt it in high salt concent ration in \nartificial synthetic media. We have isolated the to tal six bacterial species from agricultural garden soil of Saurashtra \nUniversity campus and experimented to evaluate its adaptability in high salinity medium. Out of total six isolates we \nhave found two isolates Exiguobacterium  sp. GSD1 (JN020918) and  Serratia sp.
