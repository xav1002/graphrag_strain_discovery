These studies have\ndeciphered the role of proteins, Na+/H+pumps, compatible\nsolutes in salt stress tolerance ( Sakamoto and Murata, 2002;\nRoberts,2005 ).However,cultureindependentapproachprovides\na vast opportunity for searching salt tolerant gene (s) ( Singh\nJ. et al., 2009; Mirete et al., 2015; Kumar J. et al., 2016;\nChauhan et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2017 ). Only a few studies\nhave used metagenomic approach to decode the microbial salt\nstress tolerance mechanisms from various environments lik e\npond water ( Kapardar et al., 2010a,b ), brines and moderate-\nsalinityrhizosphere( Mireteetal.,2015 ),humangutmicrobiome\n(Culligan et al., 2012, 2013, 2014 ). Incidentally, the number of\ngenes/pathways identiﬁed for salt stress tolerance are far be low\nthan the number of microbes which have been identiﬁed to\nreside within these environments ( Humbert et al., 2009; Mirete\net al., 2015 ). Hereby, the current study was proposed to identify\nthe genetic machinery used by microbes as survival strategi es\nin salt stress condition using functional metagenomic approa ch.\nThe current study led to the identiﬁcation of a number of\nosmotolerant genes that could be used to develop strategies to\nensuresurvivalofmicrobesundersalineconditions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSaline Soil Sample Collection and\nMetagenomic DNA Isolation\nSaline soil samples were collected in sterile containers aft er\ncarefully removing the surface layer (up to 10cm) from\nVillage Malab, District Nuh situated at 28.0107◦N, 77.0564◦E.\nMetagenomic DNA was extracted from 5g of the soil sample\n(SupplementaryMethods).\nBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions\nBacterial strains and plasmids used in the study are listed in\nTable1. The oligonucleotides used in the study (GeNoRime,\nShrimpex Biotech services Pvt. Ltd. India) are listed in\nSupplementary Table S1. Escherichia coli (DH10B) and E. coli\n(MKH13) strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.\nFurther,E.coli(DH10B)and E.coli(MKH13)strainscontaining\npUC19vector were cultured in LB medium supplemented with\nampicillin (100 µg ml−1). All overnight cultures were grown in\nLBbrothat37◦Cwithconstantshakingat200rpm.\nPhylogenetic Reconstruction of Saline Soil\nMetagenome\nSaline soil metagenomic DNA was used to amplify the SSU\nrRNA gene (Supplementary Methods). The ampliﬁed product\nwas used for next generation sequencing (NGS) with the aid of\nRoche 454 GS FLX +platform ( Morowitz et al., 2011; Gupta\netal.,2017 ).Finally,QuantitativeInsightsIntoMicrobialEcology\n(QIIME)1.9.0pipelinewasimplementedforSSUrRNAsequence\ndata analysis ( Caporaso et al., 2011 ). SSU rRNA gene sequence\ndata was curated for quality, length and ambiguous bases as a\nquality ﬁltering step. Each sample was pre-processed to removesequences with length less than 200 nucleotides and more\nthan 1,000 nucleotides and sequences with minimum average\nquality <25.Readswithambiguitiesandbarcodemismatchwere\ndiscarded. Reads were assigned to operational taxonomic unit s\n(OTUs) using a closed reference OTU picking protocol using\nQIIME. The uclust was applied to search sequences against a\nsubset of the Greengenes database, version 13_8 ﬁltered at 9 7%\nsequence identity. The OTUs were classiﬁed taxonomically by\nusing the Greengenes reference database at various taxonom ic\nranks(phylum,class,order,family,genus,andspecies).\nMetagenomic Library Screening and\nCharacterization of Salt Resistant Clones\nPlasmid borne saline soil metagenomic library was prepared in\nE. coliDH10B using pUC19 vector (Supplementary Methods)\n(Chauhanetal.,2009,2017 )andmanuallyscreenedforsaltstress\ntolerant clones ( Kapardar et al., 2010a,b ). Salt stress resistant\nclones were screened by plating the soil metagenomic library\n(∼165,000 clones with an average insert of 1.89Kb) on LB\nagar medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml−1)\nand NaCl [5.8% (w/v)]. The 5.8% of NaCl (w/w) is a lethal\nconcentration for E. coliDH10B cells and will allow the growth\nof only osmotolerant clones.
