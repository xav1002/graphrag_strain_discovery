Liu, W. Xun, L. Chen et al. Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 20 (2022) 6543–6551\n65473.3.1. Promotion of photosynthesis. An important determinant of\nmicrobe-induced salt tolerance is the improvement of photosyn-\nthesis to compensate for the energy cost of tolerance. It is generally\nrecognized that salt stress greatly reduces the chlorophyll content,\nstomatal conductance and intercellular CO 2concentration and\nstrongly inhibits the net photosynthetic and transpiration rates\n[110] . As discussed above, almost all microbe-induced plant\ngrowth under salinity stress occurs in conjunction with the mitiga-\ntion of stress-reduced photosynthesis. Increased biomass is always\ncorrelated with the net photosynthetic rate ( Table S1 ). Increased\ntranspiration by microbe inoculation will then lead to higher water\nabsorption and nutrient uptake by roots, including those of phos-\nphorus and sulfur, and thus promote photosynthesis. There is a\npossibility that the increased water absorption and nutrient uptake\nin stressed plants upon microbe inoculation is also a result of themicrobial manipulation of the root system architecture, which\noccurs commonly in plant–microbe interactions [36]. The mecha-\nnism by which microbes initiate this positive feedback in plants\nunder saline conditions is not clear. Since microbes can always\ndirectly or indirectly inﬂuence plant hormone signaling, which\ncontrols photosynthesis, it is necessary to understand the roles of\nphytohormones in microbe-induced plant growth under saline\nconditions.\n3.3.2. Modulating IAA and ethylene signaling. IAA is important for\nplant growth and root development but is not a generally known\ncentral phytohormone in salt-stress responses in plants [111] . Salt\nstress-induced plant growth inhibition results from the suppres-\nsion of IAA signaling, as shown by the decreased GUS density in\ntheDR5:uidA line and the severely reduced fresh weight of auxin\ntransport or signaling mutants, such as arf7arf19 and tir1afb2afb3,\nunder saline conditions [36]. Several studies have demonstrated\nthe microbial functions in activating IAA signaling and increasing\nendogenous IAA content in salt-stressed plants [36,37,70,112] .\nIAA signaling has been proven to play a key role in Trichoderma -\nand Bacillus -modulated root systemic architecture (RSA) under\nnonstress conditions since mutations in genes involved in auxin\ntransport or signaling reduced the growth-promoting and root\ndevelopmental effects of inoculation [36,113,114] . It is likely that\nactivating IAA signaling is required for microbe-induced plant\ngrowth and root development under saline stress, but deﬁnitive\nevidence is still lacking.\nEthylene is undoubtedly an important phytohormone involved\nin regulating plant growth under stress, but its role in plant salt\ntolerance is controversial [115] . Producing ACC deaminase, which\nis encoded by acdS, is an important characteristic of plant salt\ntolerance-inducing microbes [9]. ACC deaminase degrades ACC,\nthe ethylene precursor, thereby reducing ethylene production\nand suppressing ethylene signaling, resulting in the activation of\nauxin signaling [9]. The signiﬁcance of ACC deaminase-producing\nmicrobes in elevating salt tolerance has been recognized in canola ,\nwheat ,tomato ,barley and red pepper [116–119] . This function is\nevident based on the deﬁciency in decreasing plant ethylene under\nsaline stress of the bacterial acdS mutant and on the enhanced salt-\nstress tolerance and reduced ethylene content in the acdS trans-\ngenic line of Camelina sativa [120] and rice [121] . In another exam-\nple of microbes inﬂuencing ethylene signaling, Enterobacter sp.\nSA187 produces 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), which\ncan be converted into ethylene in planta, as well as ACC. de Zéli-\ncourt et al. [54] demonstrated that KMBA is responsible for modu-\nlating the plant ethylene signaling pathway and the SA187-\ninduced salt tolerance of Arabidopsis. They deployed the pEBF2::\nGUS reporter in Arabidopsis and found that SA187 inoculation acti-\nvated the expression of EBF2 in root tips as well as ACC treatment.\nBy using several Arabidopsis mutants, de Zélicourt et al. [54] pro-posed that both SA187- and KMBA-induced salt tolerance is depen-\ndent on ethylene signaling rather than ethylene production or JA\nand ABA signaling. Conclusively, it seems that ACC deaminase\nand KMBA have somewhat similar effects on downstream ethylene\nsignaling in different ways. Interestingly, de Zélicourt et al. [54]\ndemonstrated that 100 nM ACC during salt stress could largely\nmimic the beneﬁcial activity of SA187 on Arabidopsis , which should\nbe opposite to the effect of ACC deaminase. Due to the controver-\nsial role of ethylene in plant abiotic stress tolerance, further inves-\ntigation of the signaling perception in the ethylene signaling\npathway upon ACC treatment, ACC deaminase and KMBA is needed\nto\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d25d446ff65f7ece89978a81bbc91528477b57187ef75abe59ad5c9acaa676b2_v2"}
