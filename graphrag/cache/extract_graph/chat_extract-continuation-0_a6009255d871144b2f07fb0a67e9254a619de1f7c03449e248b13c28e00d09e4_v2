Exiguobacterium sp. GSD1 strain and Serratia sp. GSD2  were the isolates \nutilized for experiments. \n \nExiguobacterium  sp. has been found from much wide range of habitat s of all over the world. Exiguobacterium  sp. \nexhibits in wide range of habitats including cold a nd hot environments with temperature range from -12 °C to \n55°C[19]. This diversification in habitats of Exiguobacterium sp. is responsible of its adaptation in diverse \nconditions and beneficial to survive against extrem e environmental factors. Exiguobacterium  genus comprises \npsychrotrophic, mesophilic, and moderate thermophil ic species[20,21], with pronounced morphological di versity \n(ovoid, rods, double rods, and chains) depending on  species, strain, and environmental conditions[22].  Our \nexperimental results of growth curve of Exiguobacterium  sp. GSD1, suggest the down-regulation of growth under \nsuccessive increase of NaCl concentration. As shown  in figure 3, without additional NaCl concentration  in growth \nmedium it did not affect the growth of organism but  as the concentration of NaCl increases, growth of organisms \ndecreased with maximum tolerance upto 10% NaCl conc entration. Several Exiguobacterium  strains possess unique \nproperties of interest for application in biotechno logy, bioremediation, industry and agriculture. Exiguobacterium  sp. \nare capable of neutralizing highly alkaline textile  industry wastewater[23], high potential for pestic ide removal[24] 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33Growth (OD660)\nTime (hrs)Serratia sp.
