(iii) changes in ionicstrength cell disruptions due to shifts in salt concentra-tion, from 0.5 to 2% (w/v), caused significant reductionsin system performance [12]. (Even with acclimatized cul-tures, satisfactory performance required a constant ioniccomposition). (iv) rapid changes in salt concentrations\ncreated adverse effects more than gradual changes. Nor-\nmalization to constant salt concentration is essentialbefore saline wastewaters were treated. Reduced degrada-tion kinetics too occurred. Thus available informationindicated that the removal of BOD by biological treat-ment processes is reduced at salt concentrations above\n8,000 mg l\n-1. So saline wastewater should be treated at\nlower food to micro-organism (F/M) ratios, or higher thanusual bacteria Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids(MLVSS) concentrations. Rapid changes in salt concentra-tion cause adverse effects more than gradual changes. Thetreatment process should provide sufficient hydraulic\nretention time (HRT) to even out changes in salt concen-\ntration. In recent years there have been a few studies onbiological treatment of tannery soak liquor. Lefebvre et al[13] made an attempt to treat tannery saline wastewaterbiologically. They studied the microbial diversity ofhypersaline tannery wastewater [14] and anaerobic diges-\ntion of tannery soak liquor in an Upflow Anaerobic\nSludge Blanket (UASB) reaching 78% COD removal [15].Unidentified microbial consortia and halophillic/moder-ate halophillic cultures were used.\nIn our study, the focus was on salt concentration on bio-\nlogical treatment of commercial tannery saline wastewater\ninoculated with salt-tolerant bacterial strains and their\nmixed consortia isolated and identified from saline envi-ronments. Since the salinity levels of tannery saline waste-water varied everyday, a detailed study was undertakenover a broad range of changes in saline concentration.Corresponding COD removal by the identified salt toler-\nant strains was also followed. The results were compared\nwith those obtained when commercial tannery activatedsludge was treated. Variation in COD removal rate and itsefficiency with salt concentration were determined. Thiswas perhaps the first attempt on the biological treatment\nof tannery saline wastewater employing isolated and iden-\ntified salt tolerant bacterial strains individually and inmixed consortia.\nExperimental\nMaterials\nSalt tolerant ba cterial strains\nSamples taken for salt tolerant bacterial isolation con-\ntained seawater, marine soil, salt lake water (15% and20% NaCl w/v) and salt lake sediment clay; Samples werecollected from salt lake around coastal areas in Mahabali-puram (60 km from Chennai) and from Adyar beach in\nChennai. Tannery saline wastewater samples were col-\nlected from a commercial tannery at Chromepet, Chen-nai, India. Serial dilution technique was adopted and theseparated colonies (> 10\n-6 dilution) were spread plated in\nsaline nutrient agar plates (varying salt concentrationsfrom 0–25% NaCl (w/v), covering all salt tolerant, mod-erate and extreme halophilic ranges) and incubated at\n37°C for 24 h. Screening of potent salt tolerant bacterial\nstrains was done based on salt tolerance limit and time ofadaptation. The isolated salt tolerant bacterial strains wereidentified by 16S rRNA analysis (MWG AGBiotech, Ban-galore, India) (See additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4)\nCulture medium\nIsolation of salt tolerant bacterial colonies from salinesamples was made with nutrient agar (Himedia, MO12)media with the following composition (in g l\n-1): Peptone;\n10, NaCl; 5, Beef extract; 5 and Agar; 15. Solid NaCl wasadded to the agar to obtain the desired salt concentration\nand pH was adjusted to 7.0. Cultivation and optimization\nexperiments were performed with nutrient broth (NB)media with the following composition: Peptic digest ofanimal 5 g l\n-1, Yeast extract 1.5 g l-1, Beef extract 1.5 g l-1,\nNaCl 5 g l-1. Dunda's media (for salt tolerant bacterial cul-\ntivation) composed of MgSO4. 7H2O (20 g l-1), NaCl (150\ng l-1), Trisodium citrate dihydrate (3 g l-1) CaCl2. 2H2O (1\ng l-1), Peptone (10 g l-1) and Yeast extract (1 g l-1) was also\nused in media optimization experiments.\nInoculum preparation\nFrozen cultures of pure salt tolerant bacterial coloniesstored in agar slants were inoculated on 5 ml nutrient\nbroth media at aseptic conditions. The inoculated broth\nwas incubated in an orbitary shaker (Scigenics, India),150 rpm and 37°C, for 24 h. Well-grown culture suspen-sions with uniform concentration (absorbance at 600 nm≈ 1) were used as sources of inoculum for all growth opti-\nmization and wastewater experiments.\nAnalytical methods\nSalinity was measured by the argentometric method [16].Total dissolved and suspended solids were determinedMicrobial Cell Factories  2008, 7:15 http://www.microbialcellfa ctories.com/content/7/1/15\nPage 3 of 7\n(page number not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the provided text is a scientific article about the biological treatment of tannery saline wastewater.
