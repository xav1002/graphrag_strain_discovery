Moreover, cells thatkeep a turgor need even to maintain their intracellularosmotic pressure higher than that of their environment[38,39].\nThere are two fundamentally different strategies used by\nhalophilic microorganisms to balance their cytoplasmosmotically with their medium. The first involves accu-mulation of molar concentrations of potassium and chlo-ride. This strategy requires extensive adaptation of theintracellular enzymatic machinery to the presence of salt,\nas the proteins should maintain their proper conforma-\ntion and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations[40]. The proteome of such organisms is highly acidic,and most proteins denature when suspended in low salt.Such 'high-salt-in strategy' microorganisms generally can-not survive in low salt media.\nAlthough it can be calculated that the 'high-salt-in strat-\negy' is energetically less costly to the cell than the biosyn-thesis of large amounts of organic osmotic solutes [41],this strategy is not widely used among the different phyl-ogenetic and physiological groups of halophiles (Fig. 3).It is best known from the extremely halophilic Archaea of\nthe family Halobacteriaceae , and species such as Halobacte-\nrium salinarum and Haloarcula marismortui have become\npopular model organisms to examine the implicationsthat the maintenance of high intracellular KCl concentra-tions has on the life of a cell. Our understanding of thebiology of the Halobacteriaceae has greatly increased in\nrecent years thanks to the elucidation and analysis of the\ngenome sequences of Halobacterium NRC-1 [42,43],\nHaloarcula marismortui [44], Natronomonas pharaonis [45],\nand Halquadratum walsbyi [46].\nThe strategy of salt adaptation is not limited to the aerobic\nhalophilic Archaea. The anaerobic fermentative Halanaer-\nobiales (Bacteria, Firmicutes ) also use KCl rather than\norganic solutes to osmotically balance their cytoplasm,and they also have adapted their intracellular machineryto tolerate the presence of salt [18,47]. The third type oforganism, phylogenetically unrelated with the above-mentioned two groups, in which the 'high-salt-in-strategy'\nwas recently identified to occur, is the aerobic red\nextremely halophilic Salinibacter ruber (Bacteroidetes ). The\nproperties of this intriguing organism are discussed belowin further depth.\nFar more widespread in nature is the second strategy of\nhaloadaptation, based on the biosynthesis and/or accu-\nmulation of organic osmotic solutes. Cells that use thisstrategy exclude salt from their cytoplasm as much as pos-sible. The high concentrations of organic 'compatible' sol-Saline Systems  2008, 4:2 http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2\nPage 7 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)utes do not greatly interfere with normal enzymatic\nactivity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are there-\nfore needed. Such organisms can often adapt to a surpris-\ningly broad salt concentration range [5]. The list of\norganic compounds that have been shown to serve as\nosmotic solutes in halophilic microorganisms – prokary-\notic as well as eukaryotic – is extensive. Most compatible\nsolutes are based on amino acids and amino acid deriva-\ntives, sugars, or sugar alcohols [48-50]. Most are either\nuncharged or zwitterionic (Fig. 4).\nUse of the 'low-salt-in strategy' of haloadaptation with\naccumulation of organic osmotic solutes is widespread in\nthe small subunit rRNA sequence-based phylogenetic tree\nof life (Fig. 5). Not all groups of halophiles have yet been\nexamined for the occurrence and distribution of organic\nsolutes. For example, no information is available on the\ncomposition and concentrations of intracellular solutes\nwithin the recently characterized extremely halophilic\nflagellate protozoa [14,15]. We do, however, have a quite\ncomplete picture of the distribution of organic solutes in\nmost other groups of halophilic microorganisms. Glyc-\nerol and other polyols are widely used for osmotic adap-\ntation in halophilic eukaryotic algae and fungi, but onlyseldom in the the prokaryotes, the finding of mannitol in\nPseudomonas putida [51] being a notable exception. The\noccurrence of certain other solutes in halophilic and halo-\ntolerant prokaryotes is also often correlated with their\nposition in the phylogenetic tree of life.\nWithin the domain Archaea we find a few solutes not yet\ndetected elsewhere within the tree [49]. Halophilic meth-\nanogens such as the Methanohalophilus species contain, in\naddition to glycine betaine found widespread in nature, β-\namino acids and derivatives that are rarely found in other\ngroups: β-glutamine, β-glutamate, and N ε-acetyl-β-lysine\n([49,52]; for a report on the occurrence of β-glutamate in\nthe domain Bacteria see [53]). Sulfotrehalose has thus far\nbeen found only in a few alkaliphilic members of the\nHalobacteriaceae ; it is accumulated in substantial concen-\ntrations (up to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_353366ce3b8e15579a22d7450b998fef9c69941145828526360e5c828c7f87c8_v2"}
