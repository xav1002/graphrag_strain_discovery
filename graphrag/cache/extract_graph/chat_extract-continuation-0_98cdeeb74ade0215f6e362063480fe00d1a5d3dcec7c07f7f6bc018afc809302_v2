Elemental analysis of soil showed the\nexcessive presence of salts, sodium (105 ppm), potassium\n(155 ppm), and lithium (188 ppm), conﬁrming its moderate\nsaline nature. A good quality (A260/280 >1.8), high molecular\nweight ( >23Kb) metagenomic DNA was extracted from the\nsaline soil sample. Saline soil metagenomic DNA was used\nto analyze its SSU rRNA gene sequences to decode its native\nmicrobiome structure. Clustering of SSU rRNA gene identiﬁed\na total of 487 OTUs distributed across seven microbial phyla\n(Figure1). Out of 487 OTUs, we observed 153 unique OTUs\n(Supplementary Table S2). The inferred phylogeny of the\nsoil microbiome based upon 153 unique OTUs ( Figure1)\nwas comparable to the taxonomic classiﬁcations against\nwith greengenes database, with most of the diversity of the\nmicrobiome being attributed to phyla Proteobacteria. The\nphylogenywasvisualizedbyiTOL( LetunicandBork,2016 ).The\ndominant microbial phyla were Proteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,\nGemmatimonadetes ,Bacteroidetes ,Firmicutes, andAcidobacteria\n(Figure1).
