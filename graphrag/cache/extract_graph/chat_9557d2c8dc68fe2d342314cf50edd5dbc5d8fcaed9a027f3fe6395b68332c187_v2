Protein content was determined by\nthe Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method. ChemicalOxygen Demand (COD) and Biochemical OxygenDemand (BOD) analyses on the clear supernatant (centri-fuged at 6000 × g for 30 min) of samples were performedaccording to standard methods. Sufficient amount of\nHgSO\n4 (HgSO4/Cl = 10) was added to the samples to\novercome the chloride ion interference in COD measure-ments. Biomass concentrations (for growth optimizationstudies) were determined by reading the absorbance ofsamples in a UV-spectrophotometer (Shimazdu, UV-2101PC) at 600 nm.\nOptimization experiments\nExperiments were carried out in shaking flasks for optimi-zation of several growth parameters (Temperature, pH,inoculum conc., salinity, and agitation rate) in syntheticnutrient media. Growth studies on nutrient media favor-ing optimal biomass growth were also performed. In all\noptimization studies, the samples (collected at regular\ntime intervals) were analyzed for biomass growth bymonitoring the absorbance in UV-spectrophotometer(Shimadzu, UV-2101PC) at 600 nm. Growth curves weredrawn (plotting absorbance against time) for each growthcondition and the optimum value of each parameter was\nfixed by comparing the growth curves for higher biomass\nyield. The results of growth optimization studies for theidentified strains are given in Table 1.\nWastewater\nTannery saline wastewater samples were obtained from\nthe collection tank of a Common Effluent Treatment\nPlant (CETP, Pallavaram, Chennai) designed to treatwastewater generated from nearby tanneries. The waste-water was characterized in terms of: total soluble and sus-pended solids (TDS & TSS), COD, BOD, salinity, TKN andpH respectively (see \"Analytical methods\"). (See Table 2\nfor composition).\nBiological tannery saline  wastewater treatment\nThe treatment of tannery saline wastewater was performed\nin shaking flasks (100 ml batch size) at varying NaCl con-centrations viz., 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% (w/v). Thenon-sterilized tannery saline wastewater samples were\ntaken separately and the efficiency of COD removal byisolated salt tolerant bacterial strains was studied by inoc-\nulating them as pure monocultures. Samples were also\nrun with mixed isolated salt tolerant bacterial consortiaand tannery activated sludge. Blank runs were made withnatural organisms present in raw tannery saline wastewa-ter in similar growth conditions. For each run, 2% (v/v) ofcell suspension was used to inoculate 100 ml tannerysaline wastewater to which were added varying NaCl con-\ncentrations in 200 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. This was then\nincubated at 37°C and 150 rpm in an orbitary shaker.Orbitary motion of the samples sustained sufficientamount of oxygen supply (Dissolved Oxygen > 2 mg/l) toensure aerobic conditions throughout the experiment.Samples were taken out daily and centrifuged at 10000 ×\ng for 10 min in a Sigma 3 MK refrigerated centrifuge and\nthe supernatant was taken up for COD measurements.\nResults and discussion\nBiochemical analysis and 16s rRNA analysis of the iso-lated salt tolerant bacterial colonies helped to identify\nthem as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (isolate from tannery\nsaline wastewater), Bacillus flexus (isolate from marine\nsoil), Exiguobacterium homiense (isolate from salt-lake\nsaline liquor) and Staphylococcus aureus (isolate from sea-\nwater). Occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in marine\nsources and its salt tolerance property had already been\nreported [18].\nGrowth optimization\nOptimization experiments were performed for the growth\nof halotolerant bacterial isolates at shaker level to deter-mine the growth factors simulating higher biomass yield.Composition of media, salinity, inoculum concentration,\npH, temperature, and agitation rate were the parameters\nTable 1: Optimized growth parameter result s of the halotolerant bacterial isolates\nHalotolerant bacterial strains Media Salinity (w/v) Inoculu m Conc.
