In general, \nhalophilic bacteria will prefer uptake to de novo \nbiosynthesis of species-specific solutes for ener- \ngetic reasons. It is, however, important to note \nthat even organisms unable to synthesize compat- \nible solutes themselves may thrive in a saline \nenvironment if compatible solutes (or suitable \nprecursors) are supplied by de novo producers. \nThis intriguing possibility is clearly demonstrated \nwith the salt-sensitive Escherichia coil and other \nEnterobacteriaceae, which make use of effective \ntransport mechanisms for both, betaine and ec- \ntoine [81-84], and acquire a certain degree of \nhalotolerance (at least 5% NaC1) if these solutes \nare supplied with the medium. In addition, some \nhalobacteria, strictly anaerobic fermenting bacte- \nria as well as dissimilatory sulfate reducers, which \nall use the archaebacterial type of osmoadapta- \ntion and do not need compatible solutes for os- \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/15/2-3/95/616066 by guest on 21 April 2025\nmotic purposes, also use small amounts of glycine \nbetaine ([85]: E.A. Galinski, unpublished results). \nTherefore, compatible solutes play an important \nrole in saline ecosystems, both as alternative os- \nmolytes for solute producers and as vital supple- \nments for others depending on these solutes. \nThese interrelations have pronounced conse- \nquences, not only for our understanding of micro- \nbial interaction in saline ecosystems but also for \nthe enrichment and isolation of organisms from \nsuch habitats. As media supplements like yeast \nextract contain considerable amounts of glycine \nbetaine (1-3% dry weight) (E.A. Galinski, unpub- \nlished results), it is not surprising that use of even \nmoderate concentrations (e.g. 0.05%) may lead to \nthe enrichment of organisms able to accumulate \nand use betaine as a compatible solute. Other \nhalophilic organisms with complex nutrient re- \nquirements, lacking a glycine betaine uptake sys- \ntem, are therefore outgrown, unless betaine-free \nmedia supplements are used. Similarly, a het- \nerotrophic bacterial flora specialized for other \navailable solutes like ectoines, acetylated diamino \nacids or glutamine amide derivatives still awaits \nisolation and thorough investigation. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their grati- \ntude towards Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, \nMinisterium fiir Wissenschaft und Forschung \n(NRW) and Fonds der Chemischen Industrie. \nReferences \n1 Triiper, H.G. and Galinski, E.A.
