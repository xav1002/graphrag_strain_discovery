Transposon mutagenesis\nanalysis has identiﬁed the functionally active locus withi nORF2\nsequence region (1,220 and 1,330 bp). The database homologs\nofORF2 corresponds to hypothetical protein A3F84_26310 of\nCandidatus Handelsmanbacteria bacterium ( Table2). The pfam\nanalysis identiﬁed the presence of conserved domains in the\nprotein family DUF3445, i.e., protein of unknown function\n(DUF3445). The G +C content of ORF2was found to be\n69.96% and the predicted functionally active region, ORF2was\nsubcloned. Time dependent growth curve assay of SSR21C1\nshowed a signiﬁcant growth advantage NaCl [3.0% (w/v)]\n(P=0.0005) (Figure5A ) and KCl [3.7% (w/v)] ( P=0.0045)\n(Figure5B ) as compared to salt sensitive E. colimutant MKH13\ncarrying only the empty vector ( pUC19), while no signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerence has been observed on LB only ( Figure5C ). Elemental\nQuantiﬁcation of intracellular Na+inE. coliMKH13 carrying\nthe empty vector and salt tolerant recombinant subclones\nSSR21C1 clearly showed that the cloned gene insert ( duf3445)\nwithin SSR21C1 has signiﬁcantly reduced the concentration o f\nintracellularNa+ion(P=0.0174)(Figure5D ).\nDISCUSSION\nMetagenomics has the potential to advance our knowledge by\nstudying the genetic components of uncultured microbes ( Singh\nA. H. et al., 2009; Mirete et al., 2015; Chauhan et al., 2017;\nYadavetal.,2017 ).Lookingattheperspectivesofmetagenomics,\nit was used to explore soil microbiome for its composition\nand genetic/physiological mechanisms allowing successful\nadaptation of microbes in saline environments. Simultaneous ly,\nthese genes could be utilized as potential candidate to devel op\never demanding drought resistant transgenic crops ( Zhengbin\net al., 2011 ) or osmotolerant microbes for food processing\n(Fernandes, 2014 ) and waste water treatment applications\n(Xiao and Roberts, 2010 ). Metagenomic analysis based on\nSSU rRNA gene has identiﬁed dominance of Proteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Bacteroidetes, andGemmatimonadetes in saline\nsoil microbiome. These results are in parallel with the outco me\nof previous studies deﬁning microbial community composition\nof saline soil environment ( Zhang et al., 2003; Ma and Gong,\n2013; Canfora et al., 2014; Kadam and Chuan, 2016 ). Canfora\net al. has reported a correlation in abundance of a microbial\ngroup with respect to soil salinity. They had indicated a rela tive\nabundance of Proteobacteria withBacteroidetes were positively\nandAcidobacteria was negatively correlated with salinity\n(Canfora et al., 2014 ). Similarly Actinobacteria was also been\nreported as another dominant microbial phylum in saline\necosystems ( Kadam and Chuan, 2016 ). Gemmatimonadetes is\nanother well-known hypersaline microbial phylum associated\nwith biogeochemical transformations ( Zhang et al., 2003 ). The\nexistence of halophilic subcomponents within the identiﬁed\nmicrobial phylum, possibly making them capable to proliferate\nin a saline environment. These studies explain the abundance\nofProteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Gemmatimonadetes, and\nBacteroidetes in the studied ecosystem. Evolution of novel\ngeneticfeaturesisakeytotheirsuccessfulsurvivalinach anging\nenvironment ( Gupta et al., 2017; Kumar Mondal et al., 2017 ).\nThese saline microorganisms could have evolved salt stress\ntolerant genetic machinery to adapt and survive under salt\ninduced osmotic stresses ( Meena et al., 2017 ). A number of\ngeneticelementsweredecodedforosmotolerancepropertyfrom\ncultured and uncultured microbial representatives ( Kapardar\net al., 2010a,b; Culligan et al., 2012, 2013, 2014; Kim and Yu,\n2012; Mirete et al., 2015 ). However, there is a disparity in a\nnumber of reported salt tolerance genes with a number of\nmicroorganisms from an ecosystem ( Humbert et al., 2009;\nMirete et al., 2015 ). This divergence could be allied with a\nnumber of factors like unculturability ( Kim and Yu, 2012 ), lack\nof good quality genomic/metagenomic DNA ( Kumar J. et al.,\n2016) and issues with foreign gene expression ( Prakash and\nTaylor, 2012 ). An additional eﬀort was made in the current\nstudy to decode osmotolerance genes prevalent in these salin e\nsoil microorganisms using functional metagenomics. It lea ds to\nthe identiﬁcation of four unique osmotolerant clones harbori ng\nDNA insert showing aﬃliation within halophile genomes.\nGenetic and physiological analysis has identiﬁed genes en\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b9b4e29b31ebd10628494590e0c8a6d327dcbe7c72d87f26fdfb0803a778151c_v2"}
