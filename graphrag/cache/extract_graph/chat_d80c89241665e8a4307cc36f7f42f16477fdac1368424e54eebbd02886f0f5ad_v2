Well-known representatives of \nthis group are the halobacteria (Archaea), but \nalso eubacterial fermenting and/or acetogenic \nanaerobes ( Haloanaerobium, Halobacteroides, \nSporohalobacter, Acetohalobium species)[33,34] \nand sulfate reducers (Desulfol~ibrio halophilus, \nDesulf ohalobium retbaense ) [35,36]. \nThe second type of osmoadaptation (compati- \nble-solute type) seems to be wide-spread in eu- \nbacterial halophiles. However, one must bear in \nmind that mostly phototrophic and aerobic \nchemoheterotrophic eubacteria have been exam- \nined, and that at least some archaebacterial \nmethanogens also produce compatible solutes. \nHence, regarding the mode of osmoadaptation, \nthere seems to be no clear distinction between \nthe domains Archaea and Bacteria. The use of \nosmolytes has the advantage of a more flexible \nadaptation over a wide range of salinities, while a \n'normal' salt-sensitive enzymatic machinery is \npreserved. Compatible solutes are accumulated \nto cytoplasmic concentrations well above 1 mol/ \nkg water and are best described as organic os- \nmolytes responsible for osmotic balance and at \nthe same time compatible with the cells' metab- \nolism. The initial definition that these solutes do \nnot interact with cellular metabolism and serve a \npurely osmotic function [37], however, does not \nreflect the whole potential of these osmolytes as \nthey proved to be effective stabilizers of enzymes, \nproviding protection against salinity, high temper- \nature, freeze-thaw treatment and even drying [38]. The spectrum of compatible solutes \nWhen we started our investigations with mem- \nbers of the genus Ectothiorhodospira in 1980 we \ncould only draw on experience with salt response \nmechanisms of halophilic/osmophilic fungi, algae \nand plants [39-42]. Here the following classes of \ncompounds had been reported as compatible so- \nlutes: sugars, for example sucrose and trehalose, \npolyols (mainly glycerol and arabitol), amino acids \n(proline) and betaines. In bacteria, until then, \nonly amino acids like proline and glutamic acid \nhad been suspected of serving an osmotic func- \ntion. However, the few reports available were not \nonly inconclusive, contradicting each other as to \nthe presence of an ionic cytoplasma, but had also \nfailed to distinguish between de novo synthesis \nand uptake of solutes from the growth medium \n[43-46]. In addition, due to analytical problems, \nthe most common compatible solutes remained \nundetected and the apparent failure to meet os- \nmotic balance led to the proposal of a hypoos- \nmotic cytoplasm [47,48]. \nA comprehensive survey using high-perfor- \nmance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nu- \nclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on almost all \nhalophilic and halotolerant eubacteria available \nfrom culture collections (about 50 strains) and, in \naddition, on approx. 150 isolates from various \nbiotopes like salt lakes, salinas, salt mines and \nsimilar sites of elevated salinity has revealed the \nfull spectrum of eubacterial compatible solutes in \nnature [1,20,22,49], which comprises the following \nclasses of compounds (Fig. 1): sugars and sugar- \npolyol derivatives, glycine betaine, tetrahydropy- \nrimidines (ectoines), a-amino acids (proline, glu- \ntamine), N-acetylated diamino acids, N-deriva- \ntized carboxamides of glutamine, and (in \ncyanobacteria and marine algae) also methylated \nsulfur compounds like dimethylsulfoniopropi- \nonate [50]. \nThe strains under investigation included \nanoxygenic phototrophic bacteria and aerobic \nchemoheterotrophic Proteobacteria of the ~- and \ny-subdivision, actinomycetes, Gram-positive cocci, \nbacilli and related species as well as Staphylococ- \ncus and Salinicoccus species [20,22,49] and mod- \nerately halotolerant species of the genera Bre- \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/15/2-3/95/616066 by guest on 21 April 2025\n98 \nTable 1 \nCompatible solutes of Proteobacteria (o~ and y subclass) (based on data of Severin et al.
