Materials and methods\n2.1. Reactor set-up and operation optimization\nA lab-scale SBR was operated for about 160 days, for culturing salt-\ntolerate granular sludge. The system was controlled by a programmable\nlogic controller (PLC) and was maintained at room temperature\n(22 ± 2 °C). The reactor was 100 cm height with 8 cm internal dia-\nmeter, its working height was 80 cm, so that the height/diameter ratio\n(H/D) was 10. The aeration was introduced by an air pump, and two\nperistaltic pumps were used to drive the in ﬂuent and e ﬄuent water, the\nvolumetric exchange ratio (VER) was 50% for each cycle. Every oper-ated cycle of the reactor took 6 h. Generally each cycle included 5 min\nof feeding, 0– 30 min of anaerobic phase, 150– 180 min of aerobic phase,\n3–30 min of settling time and 5 min of e ﬄuent discharge phase. To\noptimize the system performance, the reactor operation parameters\nwere adjusted throughout the whole operation process, such as settling\ntime, in ﬂuent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and aerobic/anaerobic\ntime ( Long et al., 2014 ), and all operation parameters were summarized\ninTable 1.\n2.2. Seed sludge and wastewater composition\nThe activated sludge was collected from the recycled sludge of the\nsecondary clariﬁ er in the Changqiao municipal wastewater treatment\nplant in Shanghai, China. Then, the inoculated sludge was consisted the\n100 mL anaerobic granular sludge with the aerobic activated sludge.\nThe initial mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) level was 3.36 g L\n−1\nand the sludge volume index (SVI) was 148.8 mL g−1in the SBR\nsystem. The glucose was added as carbon source, and the in ﬂuent or-\nganic concentration was between 1000 and 2500 mg COD L−1. The\nsynthetic wastewater was composed of (mg L−1): NH 4Cl (500); KH 2PO4\n(140); CaCl 2(150); MgCl 2(31); and FeSO 4·7H 2O (10). The in ﬂuent pH\nwas maintained at 7.0 ± 0.1 by adding 2 M NaHCO 3or HCl solution.\nIn addition, 2.5 mL of trace element solution was added into 50 L ofinﬂuent, which contained (in mg L\n−1): H 3BO3(50); ZnCl 2(50); CuCl 2\n(30); MnSO 4·H2O (50); (NH 4)6Mo7O24·4H 2O (50); AlCl 3(50);\nCoCl 2·6H 2O (50); and NiCl 2(50) ( Ren et al., 2008).\n2.3. DNA extraction, high-throughput sequencing and analysis\nGranular sludge was collected at di ﬀerent salt concentrations: 0%,\n3%, 6%, 8% and 9% for DNA extraction. Then, the sludge samples werestored at −80 °C. The 3S DNA Isolation Kit for Environmental Samples\n(Shenergy Biocolor, China) was used to extract DNA according to theprotocol, after extraction, 1% agarose gels electrophoresis was used to\nexamine the quality of DNA. The V3-V4 region of the 16s rRNA genewas ampli ﬁed by the bacterial primers 338F (5 ′-ACT CCT ACG GGA\nGGC AGC AG-3 ′) and 806R (5 ′-GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-3 ′),\nand marked by the reverse primer including a 6bp barcode ( Zhao et al.,\n2016 ). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in 50 µL\nmixtures containing 25 µL of 2 × taq PCR Mix, 22 µL of ddH\n2O, 1 µL of\neach primer, and 1 µL of template DNA, and the PCR products wereconﬁrmed using electrophoresis through 1% w/w agarose gel. Ampli-\ncons were extracted from 2% agarose gels, puri ﬁed\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8309052ba7f51cc71d3e44f58a9bcb33a5fbeb46a6388097a26a815b8ae1d037_v2"}
