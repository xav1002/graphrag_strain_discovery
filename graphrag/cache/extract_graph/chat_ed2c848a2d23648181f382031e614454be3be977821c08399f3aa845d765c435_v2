The con- \ncomitant presence of both acetylated diamino \nacids in many of the above organisms, therefore, \nsupports the view that both pathways may be \ninterrelated and that N-acetylated lysine used for \nosmoadapation is probably derived from a path- \nway uncommon in prokaryotes (and possibly simi- \nlar to the aminoadipic acid pathway AAA, Fig. \n2). \nThe biosynthesis of the glutamine amide \nderivatives (CGA and AGGA) is presently under \ninvestigation. The observation that cytoplasmic \nlevels of Na-carbamoyl glutamine amide (CGA) \nrise when glutamine is supplied as a precursor \nmay serve as an indication for glutamine-linked \nsynthesis [67]. Subsequent biosynthetic steps \nwould then involve amidation of glutamine and \ncarbamoylation of the amino group (or vice versa); \nhowever, a separate biosynthetic route starting \nfrom glutamate or a-oxoglutarate can at present \nnot be excluded. \nEnvironmental implications \nNo natural environment is free of change - be \nit on a geological time scale or on a much shorter \nseasonal basis. Highly saline environments are \nsubject to 'disturbance' by, though rare, rainfalls \nor local underground or open fresh water sup- \nplies. Thus, their microbial floras are undergoing \nrelatively rapid changes caused by dilution stress. \nThe sudden dilution of the environmental brine \nof extreme halophiles, osmotically balanced by \nhigh intracellular solute concentrations, would be \ndisastrous (osmotic bursting of cells), unless \nmechanisms were provided to deal with such \nshock events and lower cytoplasmic turgor within \nminutes. Possible response mechanisms would \nentail rapid catabolism, conversion of solutes into \nosmotically inactive forms or extrusion into the \nsurrounding medium. Our present state of knowl- \nedge of the organisms' reaction upon 'down- \nshock' (mostly based on phototrophic bacteria) \nreveals a differential treatment depending on the \nsolute involved. Whereas trehalose (and possibly \nother sugars) is quickly degraded into activated monomers [70] subject to further metabolism and \npossibly polymerisation into osmotically inert \nstorage material, glycine betaine and ectoine are \nrapidly excreted into the medium, i.e. the envi- \nronment [76]. The well-known mass developments \nof phototrophic bacteria (e.g. cyanobacterial mats) \nin hypersaline environments probably make \nglycine betaine one of the most abundant solutes \nin natural biotopes, where considerable concen- \ntrations have been reported from interstitial wa- \nters of sediments ([74,75], J. Boon pers. comm.). \nAs has been shown for E. halochloris, this \ninstantaneous response may result in an over- \nshoot reaction, which is subsequently balanced by \nre-uptake of solutes until a steady state is achieved \n[76]. Such release mechanisms for solutes in com- \nbination with uptake systems, as studied for \nglycine betaine in E. halochloris' [77] and in \ncyanobacteria [78,79], are probably widely occur- \nring in phototrophic primary producers. The ex- \ncretion of glycine betaine (together with other \nsolutes) into the environment has interesting con- \nsequences. Besides serving as carbon and nitro- \ngen supply for many chemoheterotrophic aerobes \n[20,22] as well as anaerobes [80], osmolytes re- \nleased into the environment are used by a num- \nber of halophilic/halotolerant bacteria as an al- \nternative and easily accessible source of compati- \nble solutes, provided they posses the necessary \nuptake and regulation systems. In general, \nhalophilic bacteria will prefer uptake to de novo \nbiosynthesis of species-specific solutes for ener- \ngetic reasons.
