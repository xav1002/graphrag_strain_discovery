By subjecting A. sojae to \nsuccessive mutagenesis using several conventional muta -\ngenic breeding methods, the mutant EUN13 has been \nobtained, exhibiting a 3.8-fold increase in STP yield \ncompared to the parent strain (Lim et al. 2019). Co-cul -\ntivation of A. oryzae QM-6 with A. niger QH-3 has been \nshown to enhance STP activity in Pixian broad-bean \npaste, resulting in high protease activity in broad-bean \nkoji (Tang et  al. 2020). Ninety-seven strains have been \nisolated from broad beans, and 16S rDNA, ITS (internal \ntranscribed spacer), and 26S rDNA sequences have been \nanalyzed based on morphological classification. Bacterial \nstrains have significantly higher protease and peptidase \nactivity compared to yeast and molds (Zhou et al. 2021). \nHowever, simulations of the fermentation of broad bean \npaste by two salt-tolerant fungi and two salt-tolerant \nbacteria have shown that the total protein, peptide, and \namino acid content is higher in the fungal group than \nin the bacterial group (Lin et  al. 2022). Fungal-derived \nenzyme systems have demonstrated greater albumin \nand glutenin activity under neutral conditions. These \nvariations may arise from differences in the physical \nand chemical properties of STPs from different sources, \nresulting in different hydrolysis conditions and different \nproperties of the final peptide product (Tang 2017).\nThe synergistic fermentation of soybean residue and \nsoybean meal by adding of exogenous proteases and \nspecific strains has shown promising results (Heng \net  al. 2022). This method stimulates the growth of fer -\nmenting microorganisms and increases the content of \norganic acids, ultimately improving both fermentation \nefficiency and substrate utilization. These studies show that synergistic fermentation of soy paste using STPs and \nmicroorganisms promotes the availability of a rich sys -\ntem of salt-tolerant enzymes. This beneficial combination \nleads to improved fermentation efficiency and enhances \nthe overall flavor quality of the product. Similarly, com -\nbining STPs with Lactobacillus brevis GABA 100 and A. \noryzae KACC 40250 effectively accelerates the produc -\ntion of aminobutyric acid and flavonoid glycosides in \nKorean doenjang, significantly reducing the manufac -\nturing time of the product (Li et  al. 2017). Salt-tolerant \naminopeptidase from marine B. licheniformis can effec -\ntively improve the hydrolysis and debittering efficiency of \nsoybean isolate protein (Lei et al. 2017). A. oryzae capa -\nble of producing L-leucine aminopeptidase and STPs are \nobtained by conventional stochastic mutagenesis, which \ncan be used as industrial fermenters for the production of \nmeju, doenjang, and ganjang, as well as novel fermented \nsoy-based sauce-like products (Lim et al. 2019). Salt-tol -\nerant serine proteases isolated from commercial A. ory -\nzae KSK-3 have also been used not only in miso brewing, \nbut also as natural preparations for oral fibrinolytic ther -\napies and nutraceuticals (Shirasaka et al. 2012).\nApplication in sufu fermentation\nSufu, a traditional high-salt bean food, is made by mixing \ntofu with brine and fermenting it with microorganisms. \nIt is rich in proteins, lipids, peptides, amino acids, fatty \nacids, and flavor compounds such as alcohols, ketones, \nand aldehydes (Han et  al. 2001). The fermentation pro -\ncess of sufu is complex, and its unique flavor and nutri -\ntional value are influenced by the type and metabolic \nactivity of the microorganisms involved in the fermenta -\ntion process (Li et al. 2021b). The microflora determines \nits safety, smell, and nutritional quality (Li et al. 2021b). \nThrough the analysis of the core functional microbiota \nrelated to flavor compounds in the eight stages of natu -\nrally fermented bean curd, the results have shown that \nnine types of bacteria (Bacillus , Enterobacter, Lactoba -\ncillus , Sphingobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Tetrageno -\ncoccus, Trabulsiella, Unclassified, and Weissella) and \nsix species of fungi (Alternaria, Sterigmatomyces, Acti-\nnomucor, Fusarium , Debaryomyces, and Candida) are \nidentified as the core functional microbiota. These micro -\norganisms can significantly affect the production of flavor \ncompounds in the process of natural production process \n(He and Chung 2020). During fermentation, the metabo -\nlism of these microorganisms converts macromolecular \nproteins and fats into small molecular compounds such \nas peptides, amino acids, and fatty acids (Li et al. 2021b).\nIn addition to these specifically functional microorgan -\nisms, the fermentation of sufu also relies heavily on salt-\ntolerant enzymes, primarily proteases, α-amylases, and \nlipases (He et al. 2022). In fact, the fermentation process Page 18 of 23\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you have provided a large block of text related to food science and microbiology, specifically about sufu fermentation.
