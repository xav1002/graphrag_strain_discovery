The effect of different inorganic acids viz., HNO 3, HCl, H 2SO4and H 3PO4on inoculum pretreatment to
selectively enrich hydrogen (H 2) producing acidogenic bacteria was evaluated in anaerobic sequencing
batch bioreactors. Relative positive efﬁciency of HNO 3pretreated consortia in enhancing H 2production
(11.85 mol H 2/kg COD R) was noticed compared to other acids (HCl, 5.64 mol H 2/kg COD R;H 2SO4,
7.65 mol H 2/kg COD R;H 3PO4, 6.90 mol H 2/kg COD R) and untreated-parent consortia (control,
6.80 mol H 2/kg COD R). On the contrary, substrate degradation (COD removal) was higher with the control
operation ( nCOD, 66.3%; substrate degradation rate (SDR), 1.42 kg COD R/m3-day) compared to pre-treated
culture. HNO 3pre-treatment resulted in a shift in the fermentation pathway towards more acetic acid
production, while other acid pretreatment and untreated culture showed mixed type fermentation
(acetic, butyric, propionic acids). The bio-electrochemical analysis and dehydrogenase activity supported
the biocatalyst performance after HNO 3pretreatment with speciﬁc enrichment of Firmicutes and Bacillus .

1. Introduction
Biological hydrogen (H 2) production via dark-fermentation
using wastewater has generated signiﬁcant attention in recent
times ( Ren et al., 2007; Venkata Mohan, 2009 ). Using anaerobic
consortia as the biocatalyst for H 2production from wastewater
treatment facilitates operational ﬂexibility, permits diverse bio-
chemical functions, facilitates process stability and provides possi-
bility of using a wider range of substrates/feed-stocks and restrictsthe need of sterile operation ( Ren et al., 2007; Venkata Mohan,
2009; Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan, 2012a,b ). Despite the advan-
tages, the major limitation with mixed culture use is the consump-
tion of H 2produced in the fermentative microenvironment by
hydrogenotrophic or H 2consuming methane-producing bacteria
(MB) including homoacetogens, and sulfate reducing bacteria pres-
ent in mixed consortia (Kraemer and Bagley, 2007; Venkata Mo-
han, 2009; Kannaiah et al., 2012). Regulating the metabolic
process towards acidogenesis by simultaneously inhibiting the
H2consuming methanogenesis facilitates H 2to become a meta-
bolic end product ( Wang et al., 2011; Kannaiah et al., 2012 ).

For the selective inhibition of H 2consumers and enrichment of
H2-producing acidogenic bacteria (AB), pretreating the parent cul-
ture plays an important role ( Kim et al., 2003; Venkata Mohan
et al., 2008a,b; Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan, 2012a,b ). Pretreat-
ment facilitates a shift in metabolic functions of a mixed biocata-
lyst toward acidogeneic microenvironment from methanogenesis
and simultaneously prevents the function of methanogenic bacte-
ria (MB) without effecting the activity of the H 2-producing bacteria
(Luo et al., 2010; Venkata Mohan and Kannaiah, 2012 ). Physiolog-
ical differences existing between the AB and MB is the basis for
pretreatment procedures (Zhu and Beland, 2006; Mohanakrishna
and Venkata Mohan, 2013; Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan,
2012a,b ). Among the various pretreatment methods available,
acid-shock pretreatment method is widely used to control and reg-ulate H
2production both during inoculum preparation as well as
during process operation (Venkata Mohan, 2009; Moreno-Davila
et al., 2010; Venkata Mohan et al., 2008a; Kannaiah and Venkata
Mohan, 2012b ). Methanogenic activity is generally limited to a rel-
atively narrow pH range, between 6.8 and 7.2, while most acido-genic bacteria producing H
2can function over a broader pH
range ( Venkata Mohan et al., 2011a; Moreno-Davila et al., 2010;
Venkata Mohan et al., 2008a,c ). The acid-shock method suppresses
methanogenic activity of the cultures by protecting the spore-forming bacteria and allowing H
2to become a metabolic end prod-
uct ( Lee et al., 2009; Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan, 2012b ). Long
term studies (520 days) were reported with acid-shock pretreat-
ment using orthophosphoric acid as redox controller showed en-
hanced and sustained H 2production (Kannaiah and Venkata
Mohan, 2012b ). A shift in the fermentation process towards acetic
acid production was observed after applying acid pretreatment,
with the dominance of Clostridia and Bacilli classes ( Wang and
Wan, 2009; Liu et al., 2009; Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan,2012b ). The nature of the acid used for pretreatment will play an
important role in selectively enriching the AB (Lee et al., 2009 ).
Therefore, an attempt was made in this investigation to evaluate
the relative inﬂuence of various acids reagents viz., HNO
3, HCl,
H2SO4and H 3PO4for acid-shock pretreatment of anaerobic consor-
tia regarding both H 2production and substrate degradation in
compared to an untreated parent culture in order to identify thebest inorganic acid reagent for acid-shock pretreatment. To com-
prehensive study the functional role of inorganic acid redox con-
troller’s on aciodgenic H
2production, experiments were designed
and performed in anaerobic suspended growth reactor. Relativechanges in bioprocesses were evaluated based on H
2production,
substrate degradation and VFA composition along with dehydroge-nase (DH) activity, bio-electro kinetics and quantiﬁcation of the
microbial community.
2. Methods
2.1. Acid-shock pretreatment
Anaerobic sludge was collected from an anaerobic bioreactor
treating complex 
wastewater and was used as the parent inocu-
lum. After sampling, the parent culture was sieved to separate
the grit using a nylon ﬁlter. The resulting sludge was then used
for the inoculum preparation as a biocatalyst. Four different inor-
ganic acids viz., HNO 3,HCl, H 2SO4and H 3PO4with a concentration
of 0.1 N were used for pretreating the parent inoculum. Parentinoculum (140 ml) was subjected to acid-shock treatment by
adjusting the pH to 3 using each the selected inorganic acids
(0.1 N) and for a period 24 h under anaerobic conditions. Subse-
quently, the pH of acid pretreated inoculum was re-adjusted to 6
using 0.1 N NaOH. Pretreatment operations were performed at
room temperature (28 ± 1 /C176C) with provided continuous mixing
by a magnetic stirrer (120 rpm). Untreated inoculum was evalu-ated as the control to assess the relative efﬁciency of inorganic
acids as acid pretreating agents.
2.2. Experimental methodology
Five identical bench scale anaerobic sequencing reactors (AnS-
BR)were
fabricated with borosilicate-glass to have a total/work-
ing volume of 1.2/0.84 L and gas holding capacity of 0.36 L. Allthe ﬁve reactors were operated in suspended growth conﬁgura-
tion using sequencing/periodic discontinuous batch mode contin-
uously for 10 cycles, accounting for a total operation period of
20 days with 48 h of retention time [20 min of FILL, 47 h of REACT
(anaerobic), 20 min of SETTLE, 20 min of DECANT operations]. The
reactors were kept in suspension mode during REACT phase (Sﬁg
1). At the beginning of each cycle a predeﬁned volume (0.72 L) of
wastewater was fed during the FILL phase and contents were sub-
jected to continuous mixing (100 rpm). Each of the bioreactors
was inoculated with culture pretested with different organic
acids. During the start up phase, each reactor was fed 120 ml of
designated inoculum along with 0.72 L of designed synthetic
wastewater [DSW; glucose-3 g/L, NH
4Cl-0.5 g/L, KH 2PO4-0.25 g/L,
K2HPO 4-0.25 g/L, MgCl 2-0.3 g/L, CoCl 2-25 mg/L, ZnCl 2-11.5 mg/L,
CuCl 2-10.5 mg/L, CaCl 2-5 mg/L, MnCl 2-15 mg/L, NiSO 4-16 mg/L,
FeCl 3-25 mg/L]. Prior to its operation, the pH of each reactor’s
contents was adjusted to 6 using 30% orthophosphoric acid. All
the bioreactors were operated at ambient temperature
(28 ± 2 /C176C) under similar conditions (OL, 2.14 kg COD/m3-day;
pH 6.0) to study the relative efﬁciency of H 2production and sub-
strate degradation in comparison with the control operation.
Nitrogen gas was sparged to the bioreactor for 2 min after every
feeding and sampling event to maintain anaerobic conditions.
The reaction mixture during REACT phase was subjected to con-tinuous mixing (100 rpm).
2.3. Analysis
Biogas volume and composition was monitored via water dis-
placemen t 
and gas chromatography respectively. The fraction of
H2in the biogas was determined by a gas chromatograph (NUCON
5765) using thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with 1/800/C22m
Heysep Q column employing nitrogen as carrier gas. The injector
and detector were maintained at 60 /C176C each and the oven was
operated at 40 /C176C isothermally. The pH of the solution was mea-
sured using a pH meter. Quantiﬁcation of the H 2gas was also car-
ried out using a microprocessor based pre-calibrated H 2sensor
(ATMI GmbH Inc). The concentration and quantitative estimation
of VFA was carried out by employing high performance liquid chro-matography (HPLC; Shimadzu LC10A) with UV–Vis detector (210
nm) using C18 reverse phase column (250 /C24.6 mm diameter;
5
lparticle size) and 40% acetonitrile (in 1 mN H 2SO4; pH, 2.5–
3.0) as mobile phase with ﬂow rate of 0.6 ml/min; sample injection
20ll]. The performance of bioreactors was assessed by monitoring
chemical oxygen demand (COD-closed reﬂuxing titrimetric meth-od), pH and VFA by the standard methods (APHA, 1998 ). Dehydro-
genase (DH) enzyme activity was estimated by colorimetricprocedure based on the reduction of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) ( Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan, 2012a,b ). Cyclic vol-
tammetry (CV) was recorded using potentiostat-galvanostat sys-tem (Autolab-PGSTAT12, Ecochemie) by transferring suspension
(150 ml) from reactors to three electrode-electrochemical cell
[working electrode, platinum wire; counter electrode, graphite
rod; reference electrode, Ag/AgCl (S)] using a potential ramp be-
tween +0.5 and /C00.5 V at a scan rate of 30 mV/s. Tafel analysis
was carried out with CV proﬁles by processing through GPES-4.0software supplied with CV.322 O. Sarkar et al. / Bioresource Technology 147 (2013) 321–3312.4. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
Dominance of microbial population was traced by a modiﬁed
procedure of
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (Amann
et al., 1995 ). The 5’-Cy3 modiﬁed oligonucleotide probes with the
sequence of (16 S rRNA) and (23S rRNA) were used to the track
theFirmicutes (pB-00195: 50-TGG AAG ATT CCC TAC TGC-30)(Meier
et al., 1999 ),Bacillus (pB-01036: 50- CTT CAG CAC TCA GGT TCG-30)
(Salzman et al., 2002 ) and Pseudomonas (pB-00375: 50-GCT GGC
CTA ACC TTC-30)(Schleifer et al., 1992 ) respectively (Stable 1).
The probes were purchased from MWG Biotech. Five ml of sample
was subjected for three repeated washings (7500 rpm; 5 min;
28/C176C) recovered with distilled water for removing the dead cells
and contaminants, subsequently was suspended in phosphate-buf-fered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for additional washing. The resultingcells were ﬁxed with 4% para-formaldehyde and kept for incuba-
tion at 4
0C for 4 h. The ﬁxed cells were washed twice with PBS
and suspended in PBS:Ethanol (1:1) solution stored at /C020/C176C. Fol-
lowed by smear preparation, 10 ll of the sample was applied in a
well of gelatin-coated glass-side, dried for 1 h at 46 /C176C and subse-
quently dehydrated in solutions of 50%, 80% and 96% ethanol each
for 3 min. To start hybridization, 9 ll of hybridization buffer and
1ll of ﬂuorescent labeled rRNA probe (50 ng/ ll) were added to
the well. Hybridization was carried out for 3 h at 46 /C176C in a humid-
iﬁed chamber. Following hybridization, washing was carried outusing a washing buffer for 20 min at 48 /C176C. The hybridized bacterial
cells were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole(DAPI) to observe total bacterial population binding with the A-T
rich regions in DNA. The ﬂuorescent stained smears were visual-
ized with an epiﬂuorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse-80i) at
400X magniﬁcation. Photomicrographs were captured with an at-
tached digital camera (YIM-smt, 5.5 mega pixels) and analyzed
using NIS-elements software (D3.0). Counting of Cy3-stained bac-
terial cells was done in a single microscopic ﬁeld using a Cy3 ﬁlter
followed by DAPI-stain cell counting (DAPI-ﬁlter). The bacterial cell
count was done randomly on the selected ﬁelds (more than 10) of
the smears.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Biohydrogen
Experimental results illustrated the speciﬁc function of acids
used for
pretreating biocatalyst for both H 2production as well as
substrate degradation. The H 2production proﬁles derived from de-
signed experimental operations in comparison with the control
(untreated operation) is depicted in Fig. 1 a. All the acid-shock pre-
treated experimental operations depicted higher H 2production
than the untreated anaerobic culture (inocolum/control). However,H
2production rates varied based on the type of acid used for pre-
treating the biocatalyst. Among the experimental variations, HNO 3
pretreated culture documented higher H 2production, 4.25 (5th cy-
cle) times higher than that of the control operation. During the lastcycle of operation, HCl pretreated biocatalyst also showed higher
H
2production efﬁciency (3.6 fold higher than the control’s; Cycle
10). H 3PO4and H 2SO4pretreated culture showed 2.1 (Cycle 4)
and 1.8 (Cycle 2) times higher H 2production than the control oper-
ation’s. Based on the cumulative H 2production (CHP), the efﬁcacy
of the acid-shock pretreated culture, in descending order was
HNO 3> HCl > H 3PO4>H 2SO4> Control. When the CHP proﬁles
were analyzed individually, the pattern showed a distinctive vari-ation as a function of cycle operation. Operation with HNO
3pre-
treated culture showed a rapid improvement and approachedhigher CHP during the 3rd cycle of operation, stabilizing thereafter.
In the case of H
2SO4and H 3PO4pretreated-culture, the CHPshowed rapid increment up to 2nd and 4th cycles of operationrespectively with a rapid fall prior to stabilization from the 6th
cycle onwards. 
On the contrary, HCl pretreated-consortia gradually
approached towards higher H 2production until 10th cycle of
operation. Control operation showed initially higher H 2production
which dropped gradually and stabilized after 6th cycle at lowervalues.
During fermentation of organics, heterotrophic bacteria pro-
duce electrons
which have to be disposed off, in order to sustain
their electrical neutrality. In aerobic metabolism O 2acts as the
electron (e/C0) acceptor. In anaerobic fermentation, other electron
acceptors are necessary, where protons (H+) act as an electron
acceptors and get reduced to molecular H 2. Reduction equivalents,
such as formate, reduced ferredoxin and NADH functions as elec-tron donors. Dehydrogenase (DH) activity signiﬁes the viability ofbacteria with the function of metabolic activity. Redox reactions
for the inter-conversion of metabolites and transferring protons
(H
+) between metabolic intermediates are catalyzed by the (DH)
enzyme using several mediators (NAD+, FAD+, etc.). These redox
mediators are capable of carrying H+and electrons (e/C0) and are
known as energy carriers because they are involved in biologicalenergy generation (ATP). DH activity of the biocatalyst showed a
marked improvement after applying acid-shock pretreatment indi-
cating the increased redox inter-conversion reactions leading to
the higher proton gradient in the cell that may result in higher
H
2production ( Fig. 1 b). DH activity correlated well with the H 2
production proﬁles. It was found throughout the experiment thatDH activity synchronized H
2production. Similar to H 2production,
HNO 3pretreated consortia showed high DH activity (3.56 lg/ml of
Toulene; Cycle 10) followed by HCl (3.16 lg/ml of Toulene; Cycle
10), H 3PO4(2.89lg/ml of Toulene; Cycle 10), control (1.66 lg/ml
of Toulene; Cycle 10) and H 2SO4(1.5lg/ml of Toulene; Cycle 10)
operations correlating with H 2production. HNO 3treated culture
showed higher DH activity throughout the operation. Dehydroge-
nase activity of the HNO 3pretreated biocatalyst got stabilized
towards increased proton shuttling between metabolic intermedi-ates leading to higher H
2production.
Biogas composition analysis documented the dominance of H 2
over methane with the acid-shock pretreated operation due to
the selective enrichment of speciﬁc H 2producing bacteria
(Fig. 1 c). HNO 3pretreated operation documented a higher fraction
of H 2(41–46%) in biogas followed by HCl (27–42%), H 3PO4
(28–36%) and H 2SO4(18–26%). On the contrary, control operation
showed higher fraction of methane (36–41%) than H 2(13–21%)
in the biogas indicating metabolism more inclined towards meth-anogenesis presumably due to the co-existence/domination of MB.
Among all the pretreated operation, co-existence of methane was
more with the H
2SO4operation (26–33%).
3.2. Acid metabolites Vs redox microenvironment
3.2.1. VFA
concentration
Dark-fermentation process associates with metabolic conver-
sion of
organic substrate to H 2along with acid metabolic interme-
diates i.e. volatile fatty acids (VFA). During the ﬁrst six cycles of
operation, all the experimental variations documented inconsis-
tencies in VFA production pattern, varying between 950 and
1400 mg/l ( Fig. 2 a). A higher concentration of VFA production
was observed during the initial cycle (2 and 3 rd cycles) operationirrespective of the experimental variations studied. The untreated
culture showed rapid VFA synthesis and attained the highest con-
centration of 1380 mg/l (3rd cycle) prior to a rapid drop before sta-
bilizing at 8
thcycle (1195 mg/l). Similar to the control operation,
H3PO4pretreated culture followed the same trend but with lesser
VFA concentration (1380 mg/l; cycle 3) prior its stabilization at
the 8th cycle relatively higher VFA concentration (1210 mg/l).O. Sarkar et al. / Bioresource Technology 147 (2013) 321–331 323HNO 3pretreated biocatalyst approached a peak during the 2nd
cycle in VFA concentration (1260 mg/l) followed by a sharp drop
(next two cycles) and approached stabilized higher concentration
at 6th cycle (1280 mg/l). Next to HNO 3culture, HCL pretreated bio-
catalyst showed higher VFA concentration during stabilized phase
of operation (cycle 10, 1263 mg/l). H 2SO4pretreated culture
showed low VFA production (1102 mg/l; 10th cycle) during stabi-lized phase of operation, even compared to the control operation
(1198 mg/l; 10th cycle). During the stabilized phase of operation,
the VFA concentration varied in a narrow range (1150–1300 mg/
l). Higher VFA production in the case of HNO
3and HCl demon-
strates the effective functioning of the acidogenic metabolicprocess towards higher H
2production.3.2.2. VFA proﬁle
The composition and concentration of VFA showed distinct var-
iation based
on the nature of the biocatalyst used (Fig. 2 b). All the
experimental variations showed the presence of acetic acid, butyric
acid and propionic acid with variable concentrations. Acetic acidwas found in major fraction compared to butyrate and propionate
in acid pretreated cultures than untreated biocatalyst. Acetate com-
position showed an increase with time in all the experimental con-
ditions except in the case of the HCl and control operations. HNO
3
pretreated operation showed higher acetate production (57.2%),followed by HNO
3(38.2%), H 3PO4(43.8%) and H 2SO4(32.7%). The
control operation documented lower acetic acid production(16.9%) followed by butric acid (10%) and propoinic acid (8.6%).

through gas chromatography.324 O. Sarkar et al. / Bioresource Technology 147 (2013) 321–331Based on the metabolic pathway used by the microorganism and
the corresponding end-products, H 2yields were variable. Highest
theoretical yield of four moles of H 2per mole of glucose can be ob-
tained when acetate is the fermentation end-product (Venkata Mo-
han and Kannaiah, 2012). Higher acetic acid synthesis in acid
treated cultures corobrated well with the H 2production observed.
Along with acetate, the butyrate fraction was also found more inacid pre-treated cultures than the control operation. Theoretically,
along with butyrate, two moles of H
2can be generated per mole of
glucose. The co-existence of butyrate with acetate indicates suit-able microenvironment for acidogenic fermentation. Higher butyricacid concentration was also observed with the HNO
3operation. The
absence of propionate in HNO 3and presence of very less composi-
tion in HCl both also provide a positive microenvironment towards
acidogenic H 2generation. The propionic acid pathway demands
additional two moles of H 2(Mohanakrishna and Venkata Mohan,
2013 ). The presence of relatively higher concentration of propio-
nate observed with H 3PO4,H2SO4and control operations might be
probable reason for less observed H 2production. Variation in the
VFA production proﬁle with different pretreated operations sug-gested changes in microbial composition and metabolic shift of
the biocatalyst. The acidogenic efﬂuents of H

roalgae ( Venkata Mohan and Prathima, 2012 ) and bioplastics
through microaerophilic operation (Venkateswar Reddy et al.,2012; Venkateswar Reddy and Venkata Mohan, 2012).
3.2.3. System pH
System pH plays a crucial role in carrying out the metabolic reac-
tions in
all know living systems. The accumulation of VFA observed
during acidogenic fermentation in all the experimental variations,studied effects the system redox microenvironment. More acidic
microenvironment prevailed during HNO
3(pH 4.3) operation fol-
lowed by HCl (pH 4.7), H 2SO4(pH 5.03) and H 3PO4(pH 5.2) due to
the production of metabolic acid intermediates (Fig. 2 c). Prevailing
acidic microenvironments corroborated well with the VFA compo-sition proﬁles. The control operation also documented shift towardsacidic redox microenvironment (pH, 5.0), but with a relatively less
degree due to less acid metabolites generation. Highly acidic redox
conditions (less than pH 4) are generally unfavorable for H
2produc-
tion as they inactivate H 2producing bacteria. The rapid depletion of
pH will cause a metabolic alteration of the microorganisms result-
ing in the shift of intermediates production pathway with conse-
quent decrease in H 2production ( Lee et al., 2009 ). Depending on
organism and growth conditions, changes in external pH can bringabout subsequent alterations in several primary physiological
parameters, including internal pH, concentration of other ions,
membrane potential and proton-motive force.
3.3. Substrate degradation
Substrate degradation during H
2production was evaluated by
estimating substrate (as COD) removal efﬁciency (n COD) and sub-
strate degradation rate (SDR). These experiments documented a
marked variation between the pretreated and untreated biocata-
lysts (Fig. 3 a). Contrary to H 2production, substrate degradation
was effective with untreated consortia due to the presence ofhomoacetogens, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and MB. Untreated
inoculum showed relatively higher substrate degradation efﬁ-
ciency (n
COD, 66.30%; SDR, 1.42 kg COD R/m3-day) compared to
acid-pretreated biocatalysts, which might be attributed due tothe co-existence of methanogenic bacteria (MB). On the contrary,
all the acid-pretreated operations registered low substrate degra-
dation efﬁciency, wherein, H
2SO4operation depicted higher degra-
dation ( nCOD, 66.2%; 1.41 kg COD R/m3-day) followed by HCl (n COD,
59.9%; 1.28 kg COD R/m3-day), H 3PO4(nCOD, 61.13%; 1.30 kg COD R/
m3-day) and HNO 3(nCOD, 56.66%; 1.21 kg COD R/m3-day) ( Fig. 3 b).
Lower substrate degradation observed with HNO 3pre-treated bio-
catalyst reiterates the higher H 2production due to the elimination
of MB. Elimination of MB restricts the further substrate degrada-tion towards methane and therefore lower SDR was noticed with
higher H
2yield ( Srikanth et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2010 ). An un-
treated culture has higher bacterial population with a wide varietyof biochemical functions facilitating diverse metabolic activities.
On the contrary, pretreating the biocatalysts allows for the selec-
tive enrichment of bacterial population speciﬁc towards acidogen-
esis with relatively less diversity (Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan,
2012a,b ). Higher speciﬁc H
2yield (SHY) calculated during 10th cy-
cle of operation showed higher yield with HNO 3(6.64 moles/kg
COD R) followed by HCl (4.95 moles/kg COD R), H 2SO4(2.42 moles/

COD R) operations ( Fig. 3 c).
3.4. Bacterial community structure
3.4.1. Gram
Staining
In this study, the gram staining technique was used as a tool or
amarker
to enumerate the shift/distribution in the bacterial com-munity during H 2production. Interestingly, Gram staining illus-
trated distinct changes in the community in correlation to
experime ntal
variation studied. The dominance of gram positive
bacteria was evidenced in the HNO 3treated operation (2.1 /C2105-
cells/ml), which yielded higher H 2production ( Tables 1 and 2 ). The
total number of gram positive bacteria (2.1 /C2105cells) was two
folds higher than the gram negative bacteria (0.12 /C2105cells/
ml). Gram positive bacteria is a bacteria that includes Firmicutes
generally associated with H 2producing Bacillus and Clostridia clas-
ses. Many of these species also have the ability to form endosporeswhich are able to tolerate various stress conditions viz., high tem-
perature, extreme pH, nutrient stress, etc. and revert when normal
conditions regained back. In the case of HCl pre-treated culture
(1.06 /C210
5cells/ml; 1.1 /C2105cells/ml) and control (1.01 /C2105-
cells/ml; 1.16 /C2105cells/ml) both gram positive and gram nega-
tive bacteria are more or less the same. On the contrary, H 2SO4
operation showed lower gram positive bacterial cells (0.89 /C2105-
cells/ml) than the gram negative bacteria (1.24 /C2105cells/ml)
which also yielded less H 2production compared to other pre-treat-
ment strategies. This trend was noticed with control operation inthe distribution between gram positive (1.16 /C210
5cells/ml) and
gram negative bacterial cells (1.16 /C2105cells/ml).
3.4.2. Diversity quantiﬁcation using FISH
The phylogenetic compositions of bacterial communities in dif-
ferent acids
pretreatment were analyzed by ﬂuorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) (Amann et al., 1995 ). FISH facilitates phyloge-
netic analysis as well as provides the quantitative abundance of thebacteria. Phylum and genus speciﬁc Cy3 labeled probes targeted to
16S rRNA sequences of Firmicutes (phyla), Pseudomonas (genus)
and 23S rRNA sequences of Bacillus (genus) were used in this study .
Simultaneously total bacterial population count was done by
counterstaining the smear with a DAPI stain which served to differ-
entiate the speciﬁc bacteria among the total bacterial population.
The distribution of the bacterial community after acid-shock pre-
treatment induced signiﬁcant changes (Sﬁg 2). Direct cell counting
of microscopic images revealed that Gram-positive bacteria (Firmi-
cutes ) were frequently detected in all the acid-shock pretreated
cultures associated with Bacillus as prevailing genus. However,
based on FISH counting, the abundance of the probe pB-00195-
hybridized Firmicutes group accounted for 81.1% of the total cells,
which was higher than that of probe pB-01036-hybridized Bacillus
and probe pB-00375-hybridized Pseudomonas genus. HNO
3acid
pre-treated application affected the species composition of themicrobial communities signiﬁcantly by enriching potentially di-
verse microﬂora compared to other acids and control, especially
pertaining to H
2production. HNO 3pretreated inoculum showed
highest population of bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes
(81.1%) along with Bacillus (61.9%) with relatively less fraction of
Pseudomonas (14.7%). More or less a similar trend was observed
with HCl where Pseudomonas showed higher number of bacterial
population compared to HNO 3pretreated inoculum ( Firmicutes ,
50.7%; Bacillus , 64.3%; Pseudomonas , 58.8%). H 3PO4(Firmicutes ,
51.7%; Bacillus , 30.8%; Pseudomonas , 84.7%) and H 2SO4(Firmicutes ,
60.7%; Bacillus , 30.0%; Pseudomonas , 79.2%) pretreatment, the ﬂo-
rescence intensity was very low when no signiﬁcant bio-H 2pro-
duction was observed, presumably because the cells in theinoculum were damaged by the strong acid pretreatment. on the
contrary, untreated culture (control) showed relatively less bacte-
rial population ( Firmicutes , 18.8%; Bacillus , 20.3%; Pseudomonas ,
30%) which is correlating well with the substrate degradation(COD removal) rates of the control.
Type of acid used for pre-treating parent inoculum showed
marked inﬂuence
on the community structure and collaborates
well with the H 2production data as well. Higher fraction of gram
positive bacteria also correlates well with selective enrichment326 O. Sarkar et al. / Bioresource Technology 147 (2013) 321–33103691215

also infers change in the size and composition of the population.
In the case of the control operation, none of the studied bacterial
groups were dominant. This might be due to the greater diversity
of the population containing both the producers and utilizers of
H2. Bacteria belonging to Firmicutes , especially Bacillus and Clos-
tridia are spore formers and well known potential H 2producers
(Esteso et al., 1996; Robert et al., 2007; Karakashev et al., 2009 ),
which might have survived the harsh acidic conditions by formingendospores. Firmicutes grow in acidogenic microenvironment (be-
tween pH 4.5 and 6.0) and form endospores in adverse conditions(Myoung et al., 2009; Venkata Mohan et al., 2011b). Under acidic
and high temperature conditions, the cells of Firmicutes undergo
desiccation and forms spores (Robert et al., 2007; Thong et al.,2008; Kannaiah et al., 2012). Microorganisms which are not capa-
ble of spore forming (mostly probably methanogens) get elimi-
nated from the parent culture after the application acid-shock
pretreatment. Bacilli species viz., B. Subtilis ,B. licheniformis and B.
Coagulans were reported to be capable of producing H

species viz., C. butyricum, C. Kluyveri and C. pasteurianum (Esteso
et al., 1996 ),C. acetobutylicum (Esteso et al., 1996; Karakashev
et al., 2009 ) were also reported to be capable of producing H 2
effectively.3.5. Bio-electrochemical activity
Bio-electrochemical behavior of the biocatalyst in terms of oxi-
dation and
reduction catalytic currents was studied by employing
cyclic voltammetry (CV) ( Rabaey et al., 2004; Raghavulu et al.,
2012 ). Voltammograms (Vs Ag/AgCl (S) visualized distinct varia-
tions in biocatalyst behavior between acid-shock pretreated and
control operation ( Fig. 4 ). Acid-shock pretreated biocatalysts re-
corded higher redox catalytic currents than the control operation.Voltammograms recorded with untreated biocatalyst visualized
simultaneous redox catalytic currents with a marginal inclination
towards reduction behavior (oxidative catalytic current (OC):0.02 ± 0.08
lA; reductive catalytic current (RC): /C00.05 ± 0.10 lA).
Redox currents remained more or less similar during the operation.Though the reduction currents were marginally higher, lesser H
2
production was observed as the electron and proton losses willbe higher due to the multiple metabolic interactions within the di-
verse microﬂora that would have drifted the liberated redox equiv-
alents to get scavenged by MB as an electron sink or the shift in
pathway towards methane. Reversible peaks were visualized on
the voltamogram at 6 h and 12 h with peak potentials of
0.282 mV and 0.403 mV corresponding to cytochrome-c and ni-
trate reductase respectively. Cytochrome-c is a mobile carrierTable 2

ated with almost all kinds of bacterial species. As the control oper-
ation includes diverse microﬂora, nitrate reductase detected
during the 12 h would have been involved in the metabolism of
nitrifying bacteria. Nitrate reductase (assimilatory nitrogen reduc-
tase) is a mononuclear Mo-containing enzyme, which reduces
nitrate (NO 3/C0) to nitrite (NO 2/C0) using NADH + H+as source of
reducing equivalents ( Gonzalez et al., 2006 ).
Among the pre-treated operations, the HNO 3biocatalyst
showed higher redox currents followed by HCl, H 3PO4,H2SO4and
control operations, which was in line with the H 2production data
and DH enzyme activity. A signiﬁcant change in biocatalyst behav-ior towards reduction was observed after applying of acid-shock
pretreatment. All the acid pre-treated biocatalysts showed the
typical tendency towards reduction contributing for the reductionof available free protons [H
+] which can be correlated with the ob-
served higher H 2production. Relatively, higher redox catalytic cur-
rents were observed with HNO 3operation during 6 h (OC: 0.08 lA;
RC:/C00.24lA) with a reversible peak (0.292 mV) attributing to the
participation of cytochrome-c during both oxidation and reduction.
RC (/C0 0.10 ± 0.15 lA) was relatively higher than OC (0.05 ± 0.10 lA)
depicting the inﬂuence of the pretreatment method in enrichingthe acidogens towards the reduction of available free protons
which resulting in higher H
2production. Distinct reversible peaks
were recorded on the voltammograms during 8 h and 48 h withpeak potentials of 0.322 mV and 0.262 mV corresponding to the
participation of ferricyanide and cytochrome-c respectively. The
involvement of ferricyanide as the mediator would have favored
more H
2production because of its capability of neutralizing the
liberated electrons with the shuttling free protons as it is a strongoxidizing agent (reduction participant).
In the case of the HCl pre-treated biocatalyst, simultaneous re-
dox currents
were observed all through the operation (OC:
0.08 ± 0.12; RC: 0.10 ± 0.35 lA) except for a marked increment
during 12 h (0.34 lA) and 18 h (0.46 lA) in reduction followed
by oxidation (12 h: 0.20 lA; 18 h: 0.09 lA) respectively. The incre-
ment in redox currents recorded corroborated well with the H 2
production proﬁles where the DH activity for the proton shuttlingas well as their reduction towards H
2was also higher. Reversible
peaks were detected during 12 h and 30 h of operation with peakpotentials of 0.262 mV and 0.322 mV analogous to the involve-
ment of cytochrome-c and ferricyanide. The redox catalytic cur-
rents of H
3PO4and H 2SO4biocatalysts were lower compared to
the other acid-shock treatments. H 3PO4operation documented al-
most similar catalytic currents throughout the operation with a
minimum variation. A marked increment in both reduction as well
as oxidation currents was recorded during 18 h (OC: 0.13 lA; RC:
0.16lA) which correlated well with the DH activity. Quasi revers-
ible peaks which can participate either in oxidation or reductionwere detected during 12 h and 30 h during oxidation with a poten-
tial of 0.191 mV and 0.292 mV attributing to the involvement of
cytochrome-c. In the case of H
2SO4,the redox catalytic currents
(OC: 0.04 ± 0.03 lA; RC: 0.08 ± 0.07 lA) remained with a minimal
variation throughout the operation. Quasi reversible peaks were
detected during reduction (18 h) and oxidation during (24 h and
30 h) with peak potentials of /C00.04 mV, 0.04 mV and 0.031 mV
contributing to the involvement of fumerate respectively. Fumer-ate acts as ﬁnal electron acceptor in few anaerobic bacteria where
it gets reduced to succinate by fumerate reductase (Iverson et al.,
1999 ). Reduced menaquinone acts as donor of reducing
equivalents.
3.5.1. Bio-electro kinetics
Bio-electrokinetic behavior of the biocatalyst can be studied
using kinetic
parameters in the form of Tafel slopes and polariza-
tion resistance (R p) derived from semi-empirical Tafel Equations(Raghavu lu et al., 2012; Kannaiah and Venkata Mohan, 2012b )
where,
i represents current (A), E is applied voltage (V), bais the
oxidative Tafel slope ( aanF/RT), and bcis the reductive Tafel slope
(acnF/RT). This equation simpliﬁes the kinetics of electron transfer
process controlled by two parameters viz., exchange current den-sity (i
0) and redox Tafel slopes (b a,bc). Tafel plots also provide a vi-
sual understanding of the losses present in the system, which helpsto interpret the biocatalytic activity based on the derived kinetic
parameters, oxidative Tafel slope (b
a), reductive Tafel slope ( bc)
and polarization resistance (R pinX). Tafel slopes were generated
using the voltammograms recorded with all experimental varia-
tions during different time intervals (Sﬁg 3). Lower redox Tafel
slopes along with lower R pwere observed with pretreated biocat-
alyst compared to control operation.
Oxidation slopes were comparatively lower than the reduction
slopes depicting
a dominance of oxidation reactions over reduction
reactions. The oxidation slope ( ba) varied in a similar pattern with
all the pretreatment methods studied. Initially, the slopes were
0.4 ± 0.2 V/dec which showed increase followed by decrease untill
the end of operation with all the experimental conditions studied.
A sudden increment in slope was noticed in the control operation
after 24 h (1.39 V/dec) and can be attributed to the shift in the
pathway towards methanogenesis. Comparatively, lower and con-
sistent oxidation slopes were recorded with HNO 3operation
(0.018 V/dec) that was in correlation to the observed higher H 2
proﬁles. The speciﬁcally enriched acidogens might minimally con-
tribute to the losses in the system. The oxidation slopes in all the
acid-shock pre-treated operations including control showed an
increment by the end of operation indicating the occurrence of less
oxidation reactions possibly due to exhaustion of substrate which
subsequently requires higher activation energy for the electron
transfer from the biocatalyst towards the working electrode.
Lower reduction slope ( bc)was observed with HNO 3(0.223 V/
dec) pre-treatment biocatalyst followed by the control operation
(0.226 V/dec), H 3PO4(0.314 V/dec) and HCl (0.335 V/dec), H 2SO4
(0.245 V/dec). This pattern might be attributed to the requirementof less activation energy by the HNO
3treated biocatalyst followed
by the respective acid treated operations and control indicatingreduction of the protons towards effective H
2production. An high-
er reduction slope was observed during 12 h in the case of all thepretreatment methods (H
3PO4: 0.768 V/dec; HCl: 0.732 V/dec;
H2SO4: 0.711 V/dec; HNO 3: 0.676 V/dec; Control: 0.555 V/dec)
while the increment was signiﬁcant with H 3PO4and HCl indicating
less number of reduction reactions, possibly due to relatively lessavailability of the free protons visualized also with the lower DH
activity. Though higher reduction (lower bc) was observed with
control operation, less H
2production was achieved which corre-
lates well with the electron loss or the pathway towardsmethanogenesis.
The resistance for the electron transfer from the biocatalyst at
thesolution
electrode interface can be understood through polari-
zation resistance (R p) derived from Tafel analysis ( Wang et al.,
2011 ). At lower resistance electrons mobility will be higher to
get reduced with a proton facilitating H 2formation. Lower R P
was recorded with HNO 3(1.87 K O) pre-treated biocatalyst fol-
lowed by HCl (6.7 KO ), H 2SO4(33.2 K O), H 3PO4(37.0 KO ) and con-
trol (37.0 KO ). This indicates that the resistance offered by the
enriched acidogenic bacteria to transfer electrons by HNO 3opera-
tion was comparatively less than the other acid-shock pretreated
operations and control towards effective H 2production by control-
ling the electron transfer kinetics. The control operation containsdiverse species; the probability to undergo many possible meta-
bolic interactions has higher electron losses subsequently resulting
in the less transfer of redox equivalents. Electro kinetic evaluation
enumerated that the acid-shock pretreated biocatalyst has speciﬁc
functions over the control operation by controlling the kinetics ofO. Sarkar et al. / Bioresource Technology 147 (2013) 321–331 329electron transfer as well as the redox reactions by the minimiza-
tion of activation losses to succeed over the thermodynamic barrier
towards effective H 2production. The viability of acid-shock pre-
treated biocatalyst towards H 2production was also visible by the
selective enrichment of H 2producers viz., Firmicutes and Bacillus .
4. Conclusions
Performance of selectively enriched anaerobic consortia by dif-
ferent inorganic
acids in comparison with an untreated parent cul-
ture showed marked variation in H 2production and wastewater
treatment efﬁciency. The study documented the positive inﬂuence
of HNO 3pretreated biocatalyst on H 2production. Dehydrogenase
activity improved the after application of acid pretreatment, indi-cating increased redox inter-conversion reactions leading to a
higher proton gradient in the cell. Higher acetate production ob-
served in acid pretreated cultures coraborated well with the H
2
production. VFA production suggested shifts in the metabolicactivity of the biocatalyst, microbial community indicated selective
enrichment of Firmicutes and Bacillus sp. after pre-treatment
application.
