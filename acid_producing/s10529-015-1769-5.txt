Abstract Lactic acid is an important commodity
chemical having a wide range of applications. Micro-
bial production effectively competes with chemical
synthesis methods because biochemical synthesispermits the generation of either one of the two
enantiomers with high optical purity at high yield
and titer, a result which is particularly beneﬁcial for
the production of poly(lactic acid) polymers having
speciﬁc properties. The commercial viability ofmicrobial lactic acid production relies on utilization
of inexpensive carbon substrates derived from agri-
cultural or waste resources. Therefore, optimal lacticacid formation requires an understanding and engi-
neering of both the competing pathways involved in
carbohydrate metabolism, as well as pathways leadingto potential by-products which both affect product
yield. Recent research leverages those biochemical
pathways, while researchers also continue to seekstrains with improved tolerance and ability to perform
under desirable industrial conditions, for example, of
pH and temperature.Keywords Lactate /C1Lignocellulosic hydrolysate /C1

Introduction
Lactic acid is a three carbon a-hydroxycarboxylic acid
with a single chiral center, which therefore exists asone of two stereoisomers, D-lactic acid and L-lactic
acid. A weak acid with a pK
Aof 3.86, lactic acid
(lactate) has a wide range of applications in the food,cosmetic, agricultural and pharmaceutical industries
(Hofvendahl and Hahn-Ha ¨gerdal 2000 ; Datta and
Henry 2006 ; Okano et al. 2010 ). Lactate is also of
interest for its potential chemical conversion into other
high volume chemicals, such as hydrogenation to 1,2-
propanediol or dehydration to acrylic acid (Datta andHenry 2006 ; Gao et al. 2011 ). Lactic acid is principally
used as the starting material for poly(lactic acid)
(PLA), a renewable and biodegradable polymer(Wehrenberg 1981 ; Kharas et al. 1994 ). PLA can be
produced via the cyclic dimer lactide which allows for
a controlled polymer molecular weight (Drumrightet al. 2000 ). Several properties of PLA including
crystallinity and thermal stability are moreover
impacted by the relative fraction of the
L- and D-
isomers either in the polymer chain or in blends
(Gruber et al. 1992 ,1996 ; Lunt 1998 ; Blomqvist 2001 ;
de Jong et al. 2001 ; Tsuji 2002 ; Tsuji and Fukui 2003 ).

can generate exclusively either L-lactic acid or D-lactic
acid, depending on which lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) enzyme is expressed to convert pyruvate to
lactate as the ﬁnal biochemical step. Thus, a great
advantage of the biological route is the generation ofoptically pure lactate which directly affects the
subsequent polymer composition (Wehrenberg 1981 ;
Blomqvist 2001 ; Tsuji 2002 ).
As a commodity chemical, lactic acid must be
biologically produced from cheap starting materials
derived from agricultural sources such as the carbo-hydrate glucose. The ultimate yield of lactic acid (i.e.,
g product generated per g substrate consumed) is
determined both by the biochemical pathways in uppermetabolism which convert the carbohydrate into
metabolic intermediates and by pathways in lower
metabolism which potentially generate undesirableby-products. Thus, research can broadly be catego-
rized as affecting upper metabolism or lower
metabolism.
Upper metabolism involved in lactic acid formation
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are classiﬁed as either
homofermentative orheterofermentative based on the
metabolism of glucose. Although the terms are
typically applied to LAB, many other organisms that
generate lactic acid share features of the samepathways and can be considered homofermentative
or heterofermentative. As the name implies, a homo-
fermentative lactic acid process is one which poten-tially generates lactate alone. In this case, glucose is
metabolized through the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
(EMP) pathway (Fig. 1a, b). Key enzymes in the EMP
pathway include glucose-6P isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9),
6-phosphofructokinase (EC. 2.7.1.11), and fructose-
bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.2.1.13). Conversion ofglucose exclusively through the EMP pathway leads to
a maximum theoretical yield of 2 mol lactate per mol
glucose:
Glucose + 2P + 2ADP !2Lactate + 2ATP + 2H
2O
ð1Þ
In contrast, a heterofermentative lactic acid process
is one in which a signiﬁcant fraction of the glucose is
metabolized via the phosphoketolase (PK) pathway(Fig. 1a): from six-carbon gluconate-6P, the enzyme
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44)
cleaves of a CO 2to form ribulose-5P, and then
phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9) generates glyceralde-
hyde-P and acetate-P. Once metabolism has commit-
ted to acetate-P formation, this 2-carbon metabolite isnot readily converted ‘‘back’’ to a 3-carbon compound,
constraining this pathway to a maximum theoretical
yield of 1 mol lactate per mol glucose. If the acetate-Pformed is hydrolyzed to acetate by acetate kinase, then
the stoichiometric conversion of glucose through the
PK pathway becomes:
Glucose þ2NAD P ðÞ þ P
iþ2ADP
!Lactate þAcetate þCO 2þ2NAD P ðÞH
þ2ATP þH2O ð2Þ
Equation 2is incomplete since NAD(P)H must be
oxidized to complete a redox balance. Depending onenzymes present, NAD(P) is regenerated as a result of
the reduction of O
2or the reduction of other
metabolites.
A third pathway found in upper metabolism that
inﬂuences lactic acid formation is the pentose phos-
phate (PP) pathway (Fig. 1b). In this pathway, the
5-carbon ribulose-5P formed through 6-phosphoglu-
conate dehydrogenase partitions between xylulose-5P
and ribose-5P (two 5-carbon compounds), that arereversibly shuttled through sedoheptulose-7P and
glyceraldehyde-3P (7-carbon ?3-carbon), and ery-
throse-4P and fructose-6P (4-carbon ?6-carbon) by
the actions of the key enzymes transaldolase (EC
2.2.1.2) and transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1). The EMP
pathway mediates the conversion of the fructose-6Pgenerated by the PP pathway ultimately into glycer-
aldehyde-3P. If glucose is metabolized exclusively
through the PP pathway to glyceraldehyde-3P andfructose-6P and the latter is converted to glyceralde-
hyde-3P via the EMP pathway, then the maximum
theoretical lactate yield is 1.67 mol per mol glucose:
3Glucose þ6NAD P ðÞ þ 5P
iþ5ADP !5Lactate
þ3CO 2þ6NAD P ðÞHþ5ATP þ2H2O
ð3Þ
Equation 3is also incomplete, however, since
additional reduced compounds (such as H 2O) must
be generated to satisfy the redox balance.
Many microorganisms are able to metabolize
pentoses such as D-xylose or L-arabinose, leading to956 Biotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972
123lactate formation. Of course, these organisms must
have an appropriate transport mechanism andenzymes to enter one of the major pathways describedabove. Because the PK pathway partitions 5-carbon
compounds directly into glyceraldehyde-3P and ace-tate-P, the conversion of pentoses through this

key enzymes in the PP pathway are: ( E) transaldolase (EC

ethanol (see Fig. 2). Not every lactic acid-generating microor-
ganism expresses all the enzymes shown, and some microor-ganisms deviate from this general schemeBiotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972 957
123pathway results in a maximum yield of 1 mol lactate
per mol pentose. Using xylose as an example pentose:
Xylose þ2ADP þ2Pi!Lactate þAcetate þ2ATP
þ2H2O
ð4Þ
Equation 4is written with the assumptions that the
product of the PK pathway, acetate-P, is convertedentirely to acetate, and that xylose transport into the
cell is by facilitated diffusion (and does not consume
ATP).
Alternatively, pentoses such as D-xylose or L-
arabinose can be metabolized by the PP pathway.
Because this pathway does not commit the cells toacetate-P formation, the maximum theoretical yield of
lactate in this case is 1.67 mol/mol pentose:
Fig. 1 continued958 Biotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972
1233Xylose þ2Piþ2ADP !5Lactate þ2ATP ð5Þ
Importantly, because Eq. 5is redox balanced, the
conversion of pentoses to lactate can proceed like ahomofermentative process if the PP pathway is the
exclusive metabolic pathway used for the conversion.
However, the PK pathway generates 2 ATP/molxylose consumed (Eq. 4) while the PP pathway
generates 0.67 ATP/mol xylose consumed (Eq. 5).
Many microbial species have two or three of these
pathways, and thus the resulting intermediate lactate
yield is determined by which pathway predominates
under the particular growth conditions. Based onEqs. 1–5, the theoretical lactate yield from glucose
resulting from the EMP, PP or PK pathways is 2, 1.67 or
1 mol, respectively. The lactate yield from xyloseresulting from the PP or phosphoketolase pathway is
1.67 or 1 mol, respectively. Thus, the greatest lactate
yield occurs for cells which metabolize glucose exclu-sively through the EMP pathway and which metabolize
pentoses exclusively through the PP pathway.
Conversion of pentoses to lactic acid
Since different pathways in upper metabolism affect the
stoichiometry of lactate generation, lactic acid yield can
be improved merely by modifying an organism to favor
a higher yielding pathway. For example, for theconversion of arabinose, the endogenous phosphoketo-
lase gene in Lactobacillus plantarum was substituted
with the transketolase gene from Lactococcus lactis ,
thereby shifting the PK pathway to the PP pathway
(Okano et al. 2009a ). With this improved pathway,50 g arabinose l
-1was converted to 38.6 g lactic
acid l-1(yield =1.54 mol/mol =0.77 g/g) in 27 h.
Although Lb. plantarum cannot utilize xylose, the same
strategy of removing the PK pathway and introducing
the PP pathway allowed a strain which also expressedtwo xylose-assimilation genes to generate 41.2 g lactic
acid l
-1from 50 g xylose l-1(yield =1.65 mol/
mol=0.82 g/g) in 60 h (Okano et al. 2009b ). In both
these studies with Lb. plantarum ,u s i n ga n ldhL mutant
led predominantly to the D-lactate isomer. Introducing
theLactobacillus pentosus xylose-assimilating operon
xylAB intoLb. plantarum ldhL with additional knock-
outs in two phosphoketolase genes and a chromosom-
ally integrated transketolase gene ( tkt) allowed the
strain to generate 74 g D-lactic acid l-1from a mixture
of 25 g xylose l-1and 75 g glucose l-1in 36 h without
catabolite repression (Yoshida et al. 2011 ).
An organism which is able to use xylose, L. lactis
IO-1 uses the PP pathway, at least partly, because the
microbe naturally attains a yield greater than 1 mollactate/mol glucose (Tanaka et al. 2002 ). Merely
increasing the culture xylose concentration increases
the lactate yield. Subsequent sequencing showed thatLc. lactis IO-1 contains transketolase but no transal-
dolase, and thus is thought to use 6-phosphofructoki-
nase and fructose bisphosphate aldolase as alternateenzymes to complete the higher yielding PP pathway
(Kato et al. 2012 ). Furthermore, the strain exclusively
produces L-lactic acid, as genes coding
D-lactate
dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and lactate racemase are
absent (Shimizu-Kadota et al. 2013 ). As an alternative
to maintaining a high xylose concentration, the nativePK pathway can be eliminated by deleting the

pyruvate (PEP) and acetyl

123phosphoketolase gene ( ptk)i n Lc. lactis IL1403
(Shinkawa et al. 2011 ). A consequence of this
knockout was a reduced rate of lactate formation,necessitating an additional copy of the transketolase
gene ( tkt) to restore the rate, and suggesting that lactate
formation in Lc. lactis is limited by the ﬂux through
the PP pathway.
Conversion of sucrose to lactic acidAnE. coli engineered to accumulate D-lactic acid
from sucrose was constructed by a knockout in thesucrose repressor gene ( cscR ), leading to 85 g D-lactic
acid l
-1in 84 h with a yield of 0.85 g/g (Wang et al.
2012 ). A strain engineered to accumulate L-lactic acid,
also evolved for improved growth on sucrose, resulted
in the generation of 97 g L-lactic acid l-1with a yield
of 0.9 g/g in a deﬁned medium containing sucrose(Wang et al. 2013 ). This strain also converts sugarcane
molasses and corn steep liquor to 75 g
L-lactic
acid l-1with a yield of 0.85 g/g (Wang et al. 2013 ).
The ﬁlamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae has long
been studied for lactic acid production (Zhou et al.
1999 ), and the microbe generates L-lactic acid from
glucose, sucrose and starch (Zhang et al. 2007 ). Lactic
acid production occurs only during growing condi-
tions (Maas et al. 2008 ).
Conversion of lignocellulosic hydrolysates
to lactic acid
Many agricultural substrates are composed of complex
carbohydrates which must be hydrolyzed into theirconstituent sugars (‘‘sacchariﬁcation’’) prior to being
converted into any biochemical product such as lactic
acid (‘‘fermentation’’). There are several strategies tocarry out this overall process. The conventional
process for starch materials involves a sacchariﬁcation
step with high temperature gelatinization, followed bya second, separate fermentation step by appropriate
organisms. Similarly, lignocellulosic materials may be
chemically hydrolyzed, for example with dilute acid,
prior to their fermentation.
A signiﬁcant amount of research over many years
has focused on hydrolyzing various lignocellulosic
materials chemically, followed by the fermentation of
the resulting hydrolysate into useful products, and oneproduct studied has been lactic acid. For example,
corncobs hydrolyzed with dilute sulfuric acid yieldeda hydrolysate of 26.5 g xylose l
-1, 2.4 g glucose l-1,
3.2 g arabinose l-1and 3.5 g acetic acid l-1which,
after vacuum evaporation, was converted to 80 g lac-tic acid l
-1with a yield of about 80 % based on total
sugar using a R. oryzae adapted to the hydrolysate (Bai
et al. 2008 ). Similarly, Bacillus generated 55 g L-
lactic acid l-1from acid-hydrolyzed sugar cane
bagasse supplemented with salts and corn steep liquor
(Patel et al. 2004 ).
In most lignocellulosic materials, the hemicellulose
fraction is readily hydrolyzed, for example with hot
water. Such hydrolysates contain predominantlyxylose, but often signiﬁcant fractions of other sugars,
and this mixture is an attractive source of carbohy-
drates for lactic acid. The moderately thermophilicBacillus coagulans MXL-9 (described in detail
below), has been used to ferment a several hot water
hydrolysates. For example, larch extracts composed of45.8 g total sugars l
-1was converted to 40.5 g lactic
acid l-1after 50 h (Walton et al. 2010 ). These cells
consumed the glucose and mannose ﬁrst, after whichthe remaining sugars were metabolized.
Guo et al. ( 2010a ) isolated LAB strains whichthat
metabolized both hexoses and pentoses found inlignocellulosic hydrolysate. Using a corncob hydro-
lysate, Lactobacillus brevis S3F4 generated 39 g lac-
tic acid l
-1from a mixture containing about
57 g mixed sugars l-1. Importantly, the Lb. brevis
metabolized glucose and xylose simultaneously and
showed no growth inhibition or reduced productformation in the presence of 10 mM furfural and
ferulic acid. Guo et al. ( 2010b ) solated over 100 strains
ofR. oryzae and examined them for lactic acid
production. One strain (GY18) converted the sugar
mixture found in corncorb hydrolysate (233 g xylose
and 39 g glucose per kg corncob) to lactic acid,although the microbe consumed xylose only after
glucose was exhausted.
Simultaneous sacchariﬁcation and fermentation
for lactic acid formation
Another approach to sequential sacchariﬁcation then
fermentation involves ‘‘simultaneous sacchariﬁcationand fermentation’’ (SSF), which increases volumetric
productivity by combining otherwise sequential pro-
cesses. This strategy can be accomplished in severalways: (1) saccharifying enzymes and a fermenting
microbe are added simultaneously to the substrates,960 Biotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972
123(2) a saccharifying microbe and a fermenting microbe
are added simultaneously to the substrates, and (3) a
single microbe is used which is able itself to saccharifythe substrate and ferment the intermediate sugars.
Lactic acid may also be produced using SSF. This
topic has been reviewed (John et al. 2009 ), and it
continues to be a fruitful area of research. For
example, using 275 g starch-containing cassava pow-
der l
-1with 20 U glucoamylase l-1,Lactobacillus
rhamnosus generated 175 g L-lactate l-1in 96 h
(Wang et al. 2010a ). Similarly, Lactobacillus lactis
converted 100 g cellobiose l-1into about 80 g lactic
acid l-1in 48 h (Singhvi et al. 2010 ). Addition of
cellulase into an SSF resulted in 73 g lactic acid l-1
from 100 g sugarcane bagasse-derived cellulose l-1
after 48 h (Singhvi et al. 2010 ). Similarly, a Lactoba-
cillus delbrueckii which could utilize cellobiose
converted 100 g pure cellobiose l-1into 90 g lactic
acid l-1in less than 40 h (Adsul et al. 2007 ), and, with
the addition of cellulase, 80 g cellulose l-1into
67 g lactic acid l-1in about 80 h (Adsul et al., 2006 ).
The strain converted cellotriose and higher cellooli-
gosaccharides, too, though at lower speciﬁc rates.
Thermotolerant Bacillus strains described below are
particularly suited to SSF because they were specif-
ically isolated for their ability to generate lactic acid at
50/C176C or above. For example, B. coagulans 36D1
generated 80 g lactic acid l-1from 100 g cellu-
lose l-1during the course of 264 h when supple-
mented with cellulase (Ou et al. 2011 ).
Waste materials are also common substrates for the
production of lactic acid using SSF. For example,
cardboard subject to enzymatic hydrolysis is a sourcefor lactic acid production by Lactobacillus corynefor-
misssp.torquens (Ya´n˜ez et al. 2005 ). In a fed-batch
process, 23.4 g lactic acid l
-1was generated at a
0.51 g/g yield from glucose at a volumetric produc-
tivity of 0.48 g l-1h-1. Using the same strain, D-
lactic acid production from ﬁlter paper was alsostudied in an SSF. This process showed better yield
when cellobiase was added externally, reaching about
25 g lactic acid l
-1in 48 h with a yield of 0.72 g lac-
tic acid/g cellulose (Ya ´n˜ez et al. 2003 ). The improve-
ment in yield in cellulose compared with glucose as asubstrate suggests that the slow release of glucose
favors lactic acid formation over biomass production.
D-Lactic acid production has also been studied from
defatted rice bran which was not subject to steriliza-
tion (Tanaka et al. 2006 ). Because the indigenousbacteria produced a racemic mixture of lactic acid, the
pH was maintained at 5 to ensure only D-lactic acid
production by the intended Lb. delbrueckii . About
30 g lactate l-1at a yield of 0.28 g lactic acid/g rice
bran or 0.78 g lactic acid/g soluble sugars was
achieved. Recycled paper sludge generated 73 g lacticacid l
-1using Lb. rhamnosus in a culture supple-
mented with cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes
(Marques et al. 2008 ).
A challenge in SSF is matching the optimal
conditions for enzymatic sacchariﬁcation with the
optimal conditions for microbial conversion (e.g.,temperature, pH). Thus, in the case of lactic acid
accumulation via SSF, many researchers have sought
to increase the tolerance to temperature and pH of thelactic acid-producing microbes (described below).
John and Nampoothiri ( 2008 ) applied classical muta-
genesis using nitrous oxide to Lb. delbrueckii to obtain
two mutants, which in SSF of cassava bagasse starch
hydrolysate, generated lactate at a yield [90 % while
the wild-type generated lactate at a yield of about50 %.
Mixed cultures for lactic acid formationSeveral studies have proposed the use of mixed
cultures of microbes, wherein each microbe selectedfor the microbial consortium accomplishes one spe-
ciﬁc conversion. Such an approach can address one of
several speciﬁc objectives, but in each case the two ormore organisms comprising the culture must be
compatible and have similar nutritional and environ-
mental requirements.
One application of mixed cultures is based on the
concept that some microbes very effectively convert
glucose into lactic acid, while others may be effectiveat the conversion of pentoses into lactic acid. For
example, a homofermentative strain will attain a
higher yield from glucose because it relies on the EMPpathway, while a heterofermentative LAB will gener-
ate more ATP from pentoses through the PK pathway
and thus can generate lactate with high productivity
though some yield is sacriﬁced. Based on this
rationale, a mixed culture of Lb. rhamnosus (homo-
fermenter) and Lb. brevis (heterofermenter) has been
studied. This culture will generate lactic acid from a
xylose/glucose mixture or from a corn stover hydro-lysate to which cellulase was added (Cui et al. 2011 ).
Using two strains led to higher overall lactate yield andBiotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972 961
123productivity (0.7 g/g and 0.59 g l-1h-1) compared
with using only the homofermenter (0.59 g/g and
0.49 g l-1h-1). The selection of strains is important
for the efﬁcient conversion of sugar mixtures.
Another application of mixed cultures is accom-
plishing a two-organism SSF: one microbe sacchari-ﬁes the biomass while a second ferments the
hydrolysate. For example, Lactobacillus ssp. and
Aspergillus niger converted Jerusalem artichoke
tubers into L-lactic acid (Ge et al. 2009 ). In this case,
A. niger generated inulinase and invertase to hydro-
lyze the inulin to glucose, and Lactobacillus inocula-
tion was delayed 12 h to allow for some glucose
accumulation. Interestingly, the presence of Lactoba-
cillus increased enzyme production by A. niger ,
presumably because of the removal of glucose from
the culture. The system achieved approx. 120 g
L-
lactic acid l-1with a yield of 0.945 g/g in a repeated-
batch process.
A third and different application of mixed cultures
involves using a consortium of engineered strains toconvert sugar mixtures into lactic acid (Eiteman et al.
2009 ). For example, for the conversion of xylose and
glucose, the strategy uses two strains: one unable toconsume glucose, and one unable to consume xylose.
When both strains were conferred with additional
knockouts for lactate generation, each member of themixture carried out the one conversion. Such a system
adapts to a changing xylose/glucose composition by
changing the relative population of each strain (Eit-eman et al. 2008 ), and thus very effectively converts
mixed sugar streams into products such as lactic acid
(Eiteman et al. 2009 ).
Lower metabolism involved in lactic acid
formation
One common challenge for the production of lactic
acid is that numerous by-products can be generated,
depending on the microbe used and the pathways that
microbe possesses. Different LAB, particularly,
express several enzymes which compete with LDH
for the utilization of pyruvate. The LDHs present in anorganism and their catalytic efﬁciency also determine
the relative abundance of the two isomers in the
product (Zheng et al. 2012 ). Furthermore, several
paralogs show some
L-LDH or D-LDH activity and
reduce the optical purity of lactic acid (Rico et al.2008 ). Figure 2shows enzymes found in lower
metabolism of several LAB associated with pyruvate
and acetate-P, the products of the EMP, PP pathwaysand PK pathways. Different organisms have other
competing pathways, the importance of which also
depends on the starting carbon source used. Reducingby-product formation has been a consistent theme in
studying lactic acid production by many bacteria and
fungi.
Decrease of by-products formed from glucose
As a model organism which is easy to manipulate
genetically, E. coli accumulates signiﬁcant lactic acid
from glucose by simply knocking out the pﬂB gene
coding pyruvate formate lyase (Dien et al. 2001 ; Dien
et al. 2002 ). Though E. coli predominantly generates
the D-lactate isomer, it may readily be turned into an
L-
lactate producer by knocking out the native gene
coding D-LDH ( ldhA ) and a gene coding for an L-LDH
(Chang et al. 1999 ; Dien et al. 2002 ; Zhou et al. 2004 ).
Often a ‘‘two-phase’’ process is implemented to
accumulate lactic acid, whereby an aerobic growth
phase is decoupled from a subsequent anaerobic ormicroaerobic phase leading to lactate production. A
two-phase approach is indeed necessitated by the
knockout of the pﬂB gene, or any other gene which
curtails anaerobic cell growth. Advantages of a two-
phase process are higher yields because no carbon is
converted to biomass during the non-growth produc-tion phase, and greater tolerance to environmental
conditions during lactate accumulation because cell
growth is not actually required.
Many studies have focused on this strategy. For
example, a pﬂB knockout overexpressing the Strepto-
coccus bovis ldh gene generated 73 g
L-lactic acid l-1
on a complex medium at a yield of 0.93 g/g (Dien et al.
2001 ). A strain with knockouts in pyruvate formate
lyase, fumarate reductase ( frdBC ), alcohol dehydro-
genase ( adhE ) and acetate kinase ( ackA ) grown in
deﬁned medium generated 48 g lactate l-1of 99 %
optical purity close to the theoretical maximum yield
of 1 g/g (Zhou et al. 2003 ), and then replacing the
chromosomal ldhA with an L-LDH gene led to 50 g
L-lactate l-1at a yield of 0.95 g/g (Zhou et al. 2004 ).
In an acetate-auxotroph having knockouts in pyruvate
dehydrogenase ( aceEF ), pyruvate oxidase ( poxB ),
PEP synthase ( pps) and pyruvate formate lyase, all
which compete with LDH for pyruvate, E. coli962 Biotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972
123generated over 90 g lactate l-1with a yield of 0.95 g/
g with succinate as the single by-product (Zhu et al.
2007 ). Additionally knocking out frdABCD coding
fumarate reductase, and ensuring that the co-substrate
acetate was absent at the time the anaerobic phase
commences led to 138 g lactate l-1in deﬁned medium
with a yield of 0.99 g/g and less than 1 % by-products
(Zhu et al. 2007 ). A similar set of knockouts has been
scaled up to 3,000 liters and demonstrated the beneﬁtof Ca(OH)
2as the neutralizing agent (Liu et al. 2014 ).
Other combinations of knockouts which decrease by-
product formation have also been studied. For exam-ple, a phosphotransferase ( pta) and PEP carboxylase
(ppc) mutant generated 62 g
D-lactate l-1on a com-
plex medium with a yield of 0.9 g/g (Chang et al.1999 ), while knocking out the native
D-LDH and
expressing L-LDH from Lactobacilllus casei gener-
ated 45 g L-lactate l-1with a yield of 0.7 g/g (Chang
et al. 1999 ).
Corynebacterium glutamicum , used commercially
for amino acid production, has recently been examinedfor lactic acid production. With a native
L-LDH, C.
glutamicum needs a knockout in this L-LDH and
overexpression of D-LDH from Lb. delbrueckii to
accumulate D-lactate from glucose. After aerobic cell
growth, centrifuged, washed and resuspended cells (at
60 g l-1) with repeated glucose addition accumulated
120 g D-lactate l-1in 30 h in a high density resting
cell approach (Okino et al. 2008 ). The system also
accumulated 17 g succinate l-1and less acetate.
Klebsiella ssp. have also been examined for the
production of lactic acid from glucose. Klebsiella
oxytoca with knockouts in phosphotransacetylase,
acetate kinase and alcohol dehydrogenase generated
13 g D-lactic acid l-1from 20 g glucose l-1, and also
generated 24 g D-lactic acid l-1from sugarcane
molasses in 96 h (Sangproo et al. 2012 ).
There has long been an interest in using yeast,
particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae , for the pro-
duction of lactic acid from glucose (Dequin and Barre
1994 ; Porro et al. 1995 ). The motivation is that S.
cerevisiae tolerates a low pH of about 3.5 and is
efﬁcient at the conversion of glucose to ethanol
through the EMP pathway at nearly theoretical yield.Therefore, although S. cerevisiae is naturally an
ethanol producer, the microbe might similarly be able
to accumulate the redox-neutral product, lactic acid, ifethanol formation were to be prevented. For example,
a knockout in one of the pyruvate decarboxylase genesinvolved in ethanol generation ( PDC1 ) and over-
expressing the bovine ldhgene (via a plasmid) led to a
lactate yield of 0.20 g/g and an ethanol yield of 0.26 g/g, though cell growth was repressed (Adachi et al.
1998 ). More recently, PDC1 was similarly knocked
out and two copies of the ldhgene from Leuconostoc
mesenteroides integrated onto the S. cerevisiae chro-
mosome (Ishida et al. 2006a ). From 100 g glu-
cose l
-1, this yeast strain generated about 62 g D-
lactate l-1when the pH was controlled and about
53 g D-lactate l-1without pH control (ﬁnal pH was
2.8). Knocking out both PDC1 and PDC5 and
integrating two copies of the bovine ldhgene led to
over 82 g L-lactate l-1in 200 h at a yield of 0.815 g/g
glucose (Ishida et al. 2006b ). More recently, strains
with single gene disruptions were screened to ﬁnd
strains with improved resistance to L-lactic acid at a
pH of 2.6 (Suzuki et al. 2013 ). Overexpressing L-LDH
in aPDC1 knockout strain with four additional gene
disruptions ( DSE2 SCW11 EOF3 SED1 ) led to 48 g L-
lactic acid l-1compared to 38 g l-1in the strain
overexpressing the L-LDH in a PDC1 knockout. Each
of these recent studies used a medium containing
10 g yeast extract l-1and 20 g peptone l-1.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not the only yeast used
for generating lactic acid from glucose, but by-
products must invariably be eliminated and lactic acidformation enhanced. Kluyveromyces marxianus strains
were constructed with the Lactobacillus helveticus
L-LDH gene using phosphoglycerate kinase andpyruvate decarboxylase promoters at various points
in the chromosome (Hause et al. 2009 ). With CaCO
3
added for pH control and deleting the native single
copy of pyruvate decarboxylase ( PDC1 ),K. marxianus
generated about 99 g L-lactate l-1([99 % enantio-
merically pure) from 104 g glucose l-1in 48 h with-
out any ethanol production. This strain also generated
9.1 g lactate l-1from 10.8 g glucose l-1after 72 h
without pH control, which led to a ﬁnal pH of about 3.Similarly, Candida boidinii expressing codon-opti-
mized bovine L-LDH using the PDC1 promoter in a
PDC1 knockout resulted in about 86 g lactate l
-1in
48 h at a yield of 1 g/g glucose (Osawa et al. 2009 ). By
knocking out PDC1 and introducing two L-LDH genes
derived from Bos taurus under the control of the PDC1
promoter, C. boidinii was able to generate over
100 g L-lactic acid l-1in 33 h (Ikushima et al. 2009 ).
A series of patents have been issued for the
production of lactic acid in yeast. For example, withBiotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972 963
123a goal of producing lactic acid at a low pH so that base
consumption is minimized and the acid form (i.e.,
lactic acid) predominates, several yeasts with knock-outs in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and
pyruvate decarboxylase were transformed with one or
more copies of the LDH gene and a lactate transporter(Porro et al. 2006 ). The researchers noted that a higher
concentration and productivity of lactic acid can be
attained in a medium having a low concentration ofMg
2?or Zn2?ions. Lactic acid will also accumulate
using yeast variants which have temperature-sensitive
alcohol dehydrogenase or pyruvate decarboxylase andwhich express human- or frog-LDH (Sawaii et al.
2011 ).
Issatachenkia orientalis has been developed for
lactic acid production because this yeast tolerates a pH
below 3 (Suominen et al. 2012 ; Miller et al. 2012 ).
With knockouts in native pyruvate decarboxylase andlactate:ferricytochrome coxidoreductase genes and
overexpressing one or more copies of
L-LDH, this
yeast generated 60 g lactate l-1at a yield of 0.6 g/g
under microaerobic conditions.
Decrease of by-products from pentosesMost of the same knockouts involved in the conver-
sion of glucose to lactic acid apply also when pentosesare the substrates. For example, E. coli with essentially
the same knockouts as described above to exclude by-
products, as well as containing the chromosomally-integrated Pediococcus acidilactici
L-LDH gene
(ldhL), generated 42.9 g L-lactic acid l-1from xylose
under anaerobic conditions in about 120 h in a deﬁnedmedium (Zhao et al. 2013 ).Candida utilis expressing
xylitol dehydrogenase, xylulokinase and a xylose
reductase mutated to favor NAD over NADP
?gen-
erated 67 g L-lactate l-1from xylose in 72 h (Tam-
akawa et al. 2012 ). The yeast Pichia stipitis is
advantageous because it naturally ferments xylose,primarily to ethanol (Prior et al. 1989 ). Using P.
stipitis with an
L-LDH gene from Lb. helveticus
expressed under the control of the ADH1 promoter led
to 58 g L-lactate l-1from 100 g xylose l-1or
41 g lactate l-1from 94 g glucose l-1(Ilme´n et al.
2007 ). The lower production of lactate from glucose
was attributed to the greater ethanol formation from
this substrate. Despite the presence of an intactpyruvate-to-ethanol pathway, the cells generated
70 % less ethanol from xylose with ldhL expression.Interestingly, this P. stipitis construct was able to
metabolize glucose and xylose simultaneously.
Decrease of by-products from glycerol
Glycerol has also been used as a substrate for lactic
acid production by E. coli (Mazumdar et al. 2010 ). By
overexpressing enzymes involved in the conversion of
glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and knock-ing out fumarate reductase ( frdA), phosphotransferase
(pta), alcohol dehydrogenase ( adhE ) and respiratory
D-lactate dehydrogenase ( dld) genes, 32 g D-
lactate l-1was generated from 40 g glycerol l-1in
about 72 h in shake-ﬂasks. Modifying the E. coli strain
by replacing the native D-LDH with an L-LDH,
blocking the methylglyoxal pathway, and preventing
reassimilation of L-lactate by eliminating a native
aerobic L-LDH led to 50 g L-lactate l-1with 99.9 %
optical purity from 56 g crude glycerol l-1in 84 h
(Mazumdar et al. 2013 ). An economic assessment of
the conversion of glycerol to D-lactic acid by engi-
neered E. coli indicated that the use of crude glycerol
represents less than 8 % of the production cost, and
that the process could be a proﬁtable use for glycerol(Posada et al. 2012 ). Moreover, the success of the
conversion depends mostly on the fermentation, and in
particular the ability of strains to convert completelyhigh concentrations of glycerol. Another approach
involves the typical two-phase process: using a two-
phase approach without overexpression of genesinvolved in glycerol uptake, E. coli was able to
generate 99 g
D-lactate l-1in 36 h at a yield of 0.64 g/
g (Tian et al. 2012 ; Chen et al. 2014 ). Overexpression
ofldhA increased ﬁnal concentration and yield.
Importantly, a two-phase approach allows different
environmental conditions: for example, E. coli growth
is favored at 34–37 /C176C, while anaerobic conversion of
glycerol into lactic acid favors 40 /C176C (Chen et al.
2014 ). The use of crude glycerol compared to puriﬁed
glycerol does not appear to impact the production of
lactic acid (Chen et al. 2014 ), although methanol
present as high as 28 % (w/w) is largely lost on
autoclaving (Pyle et al. 2008 ).
Wild-type Klebsiella pneumoniae generates a sur-
prisingly high concentration of D-lactic acid when
subject to microaerobic conditions and high glycerol
feed rates (Rossi et al. 2013 ). If one thus accepts the
generation of by-products, the organism is suitable for
the co-production of 1,3-propanediol and D-lactic acid,964 Biotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972
123which may readily be separated from each other (Song
et al. 2013 ). Knocking out just two genes leading to
1,3-propanediol ( dhaT andyqhD ) and overexpressing
aD-LDH led to 142 g D-lactic acid l-1at a yield of
0.82 g/g glycerol (Feng et al. 2014 ). The availability
of some oxygen under microaerobic conditionsappears to be critical in maximizing
D-lactic acid
formation in K. pneumoniae (Feng et al. 2014 ).
Membrane transport associated with lactate
formation
In many cells glucose is transported across the cell
membrane via a sugar-speciﬁc phosphotransferasesystem (PTS), though variations in this strategy exist.
Lc. lactis transports glucose via a mannose-PTS, a
cellobiose-PTS (rather than a glucose-PTS) and aunique glucose permease (Castro et al. 2009 ). The
concentration of phosphate can play an important role
in the regulation of glycolysis (e.g., Lc. lactis ), with
low phosphate inhibiting glycolysis particularly at
high glucose concentrations (Levering et al. 2012 ).
Xylose transport in several Lactobacillus spp. occurs
via facilitated diffusion (Chaillou et al. 1998 ,1999 ),
while in E. coli xylose uptake occurs by both high-
afﬁnity (ATP-dependent) and low-afﬁnity (ATP-inde-pendent) routes (Sumiya et al. 1995 ).
Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to be limited in
the efﬂux of lactate, and two monocarboxylate perm-eases, Jen1 and Ady2, play an important role in lactate
export from the cell (Pacheco et al. 2012 ), though
Ady2 is considered an acetate permease (Paiva et al.2004 ). A knockout in both JEN1 andADY2 signiﬁ-
cantly reduced consumption of lactic acid from the
medium after the glucose had been exhausted whilethe overexpression of JEN1 andADY2 increased lactic
acid production but also increased lactic acid utiliza-
tion after glucose exhaustion. Thus, these enzymes areinvolved in bidirectional lactic acid uptake and efﬂux
(Pacheco et al. 2012 ). A mutation in the ADY2 gene
has also been linked to increased lactate efﬂux through
laboratory evolution (de Kok et al. 2012 ). Although
the quantity of lactic acid generated varies widelydepending on the strain of yeast used (Branduardi et al.
2006 ), these earlier studies generated less than 0.5 g
lactic acid/l (Pacheco et al. 2012 ). An almost doubling
of lactate yield to 0.75 g/g glucose under continuous
culture conditions led to speculation that thisoperational mode may be advantageous for lactic acid
production by S. cerevisiae because such a process
maintains a very low glucose concentration and thusreduces the Crabtree effect found in this yeast
(Mimitsuda et al. 2014 ).
Compared to research involving upper or lower
metabolism, relatively little research has investigated
improving lactate production through the alteration of
native sugar or lactate transport into or out of the cell.
Increasing microbial tolerance
Microbial processes for lactic acid generation are
commonly limited by the tolerance of productionorganisms to extreme conditions of pH or temperature,
as well to elevated sugar and lactic acid concentra-
tions. Furthermore, inhibitors present in the biomasshydrolysates and other inexpensive materials which
are attractive for lactic acid production can hinder
growth and product formation. Therefore, the selec-tion and improvement of strains for tolerance to
certain environmental conditions are key aspects in
process development for large scale cultivation. Twogeneral strategies have been adopted for obtaining
more tolerant microbial strains. One method involves
improving known lactic acid producers by variousevolutionary techniques such as random mutagenesis
or genome shufﬂing. A second method is to establish
ﬁrst what characteristics are needed in a productionmicrobe, and then isolate microbes from the natural
environment which satisfy those characteristics. Lac-
tic acid production is then subsequently introduced or
improved in those isolates.
Tolerance to low pHDuring microbial generation of lactic acid from simple
sugars such as glucose, the pH of the culture willdecrease. Microbes are often inhibited by lowered pH,
leading to a reduction and ultimately a cessation of cell
growth and further lactic acid formation. This pH-
dependent inhibition necessitates the use of strong
base to neutralize the accumulating acid during thecourse of the fermentation. However, the use of bases
such as NaOH, KOH or Ca(OH)
2is accompanied by
its own drawbacks. In particular, the cells may beinhibited by the increased concentration of a neutral-
izing counter-cation (e.g., Na
?), and additionalBiotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972 965
123processing steps are required to remove the counterion
and leave the ultimate acid product. So, two
approaches have been explored to resolve the problemof decreasing pH during a lactic acid fermentation,
including increasing microbial tolerance to cations
and increasing microbial tolerance to low pH.
Several researchers have increased tolerance to
cations in microbes able to generate more lactate.
Applying the hypothesis that Na
?might limit lactic
acid production, a 25 % increase in lactate accumu-
lation (70 vs. 56 g l-1) was reported in an E. coli strain
overexpressing Na?-speciﬁc regulator gene nhaR and
thenhaA gene expressing the Na?/H?antiporter
membrane protein (Wu et al. 2013a ). Similarly,
overexpressing the DNA repair protein RecO in L.
casei led to a 40 % increase in lactic acid concentra-
tion under NaCl stress, although the lactic acid
concentrations accumulated were less than 5 g l-1
(Wu et al. 2013b ). Subjecting a Bacillus isolate to low
energy ions generated a mutant more tolerant to Na?
which at 50 /C176C was able to convert glucose to over
100 g L-lactate l-1with productivities exceeding
3.5 g l-1h-1(Qin et al. 2010 ).E. coli merely exposed
to progressively increasing concentrations of Na?
showed greater tolerance to both Na?and K?ions and,
when conferred with a single knockout in the pﬂB
gene, showed a 35 % increase in lactic acid production(76 g l
-1) compared to the wild-type strain (Wu et al.
2014 ).
Lactic acid-producing bacteria may similarly be
adapted to greater acid tolerance. Just one round of
whole genome shufﬂing on Lb. pentosus was neces-
sary to generate transformants with improved growthat a pH of 4 (Ye et al. 2013a ). One mutant, MT3,
produced lactic acid at 95 % yield from 20 g glu-
cose l
-1at a pH of 3.8. These authors did not identify
the altered genes nor the mechanism for the increased
acid tolerance but the mutation did not have any effect
on lactate synthesis. Increased acid tolerance of Lb.
rhamnosus was also achieved by genome shufﬂing
using two UV mutants and three nitrosoguanidine
mutants as the template strains (Wang et al. 2007 ). At
a controlled pH of 4.5, the ultimate strain was able to
generate about 84 g l-1after an 84 h fermentation.
Similarly, Sporolactobacillus inulinus was subject to
UV irradiation and diethyl sulfate mutagenesis to
generate starting populations for genome shufﬂing,which led to a strain resistant to a pH of 5 that
generated 93 g
D-lactic acid l-1from glucose incomplex medium (Zheng et al. 2010 ). Interestingly,
a pH-tolerant mutant of Lb. casei showed greater PTS
activity, greater H?-ATPase activity and, at lower
values of pH, maintained a higher intracellular pH
than the wild-type, with a subsequent proteomic
analysis demonstrating the complexity of pH tolerance(Wu et al. 2012 ). The response of LAB to low pH
involves surprisingly numerous genes or proteins
(Rallu et al. 2000 ; De Angelis et al. 2001 ).
A source to isolate new acid-tolerant bacteria is the
corn-processing facilities themselves. Acid-tolerant
bacteria which produce lactic acid at a pH of 4.2 or lesshave been isolated directly from industrial wet mills
(Carlson and Peters 2002 ), and then subsequently
examined for the effect of temperature, SO
2, and
steep-water on their growth. Similarly, bacteria were
isolated from corn-steep liquor producing L-lactic
acid (Eddington et al. 2007 ), and six Lactobacilli were
identiﬁed. These strains each generated over 80 g L-
lactic acid l-1with 96 % optical purity and a yield
over 80 % in 50 h. After chemical mutagenesis, thestrains were examined for the absence of
D-lactic acid.
In this way, strains able to generate exclusively L-
lactic acid at high yield and ﬁnal concentration werealso generated.
Tolerance to elevated temperaturesIncreased tolerance to elevated temperature is also
desirable for potentially increasing productivity andfor reducing the prospect of contamination. To
increase thermotolerance of Lb. casei , a mutant was
selected by isolating for growth at progressivelyhigher temperatures and glucose concentrations (Ge
et al. 2011 ). The resulting mutant, named G-03,
generated lactate maximally at 41 /C176C, whereas the
parent strain generated maximal lactate at 34 /C176C. G-03
generated over 198 g lactate l
-1at 41 /C176C, approxi-
mately twice the concentration and productivity of theparent strain.
Thermotolerant strains have been isolated directly
from the environment. For example, Qin et al. ( 2009 )
selected Bacillus 2-6 from 730 soil isolates that grew
at 55 /C176C, and Bischoff et al. ( 2010 ) isolated 40 strains
on a xylose-containing complex medium at 50 /C176C, and
16S rDNA showed all were B. coagulans . Demon-
strating the advantage that high temperature providesagainst contamination, Bacillus 2–6 generated
182 g
L-lactic acid l-1in a medium of 20 g yeast966 Biotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972
123extract l-1in a 30 l fed-batch process without
sterilization (Qin et al. 2009 ) into which glucose was
fed continuously. Bacillus 2–6 also generated
60–100 g L-lactic acid l-1with over 99 % optical
purity in repeated batch fermentations at an average of
0.9 g/g yield and productivities exceeding1gl
-1h-1, though production was very dependent
on yeast extract concentration (Zhao et al. 2010 ).
During batch fermentation of 120 g xylose l-1, ther-
motolerant isolate B. coagulans NL01 generated
80 g L-lactate l-1in 72 h (Ouyang et al. 2012 ), while
B. coagulans C106 generated 216 g from xylose l-1
during a fed-batch process (Ye et al. 2013b ). Otto
(2012 ) describe thermophilic strains (56 /C176C) of B.
coagulans andGeobacter also tolerant to a pH of 5.6.
Immobilization of a thermotolerant Bacillus extends
the productivity of the process: approx. 70 g lactic
acid l-1from 80 g/l glucose during each of ﬁfteen
repeated fed-batch fermentations (Rosenberg et al.
2005 ). All these recent studies using Bacillus strains
conﬁrm research from a decade earlier demostratinglactic acid production by thermotolerant Bacillus spp.
(Heriban et al. 1993 ; Ohara and Yahata 1996 ; Payot
et al. 1999 ).
A few species other than Bacillus have been
isolated from the environment for their thermotoler-
ance. For example, an L. delbrueckii strain isolated
from a sink tolerated 50 /C176C. Using continuous culture
with membrane recycle at 43 /C176C, this strain generated
20 g
D-lactic acid l-1continuously from 20 g glu-
cose l-1at a productivity of 18 g l-1h-1and a yield
of 1 g/g (Tashiro et al. 2011 ). In batch culture
87.4 g D-lactic acid l-1accumulated in 168 h from
100 g glucose l-1. However, B. coagulans is advan-
tageous compared to Lb. delbrueckii in terms of higher
operational temperature, productivity and simplicityof medium requirements (Michelson et al. 2006 ).
Tolerance to elevated sugar concentrationIncreased tolerance to high sugar concentrations or
increased generation of lactic acid are worthy targets
for random mutation. Lb. lactis was mutated with UV
and selecting for increased acid production by strainshaving a larger acid zone on plate (Joshi et al. 2010 ).
Two additional rounds of UV irradiation led to strain
RM2-24, which generated 120 g lactic acid l
-1from
200 g hydrolyzed cane sugar l-1in 120 h. Genome
shufﬂing to increase the glucose tolerance of Lb.rhamnosus resulted in a strain which generated
180 g L-lactic acid l-1from 200 g glucose l-1in
90 h (Yu et al. 2008 ).
Tolerance to multiple stresses
Strategies have also been used to obtain strains with
increased tolerance to multiple stresses. For example,
Patel et al. ( 2006 ) isolated many microbes from a wide
range of sources, and selected strains which could
ferment sugars in sugar cane bagasse hydrolysate at a
pH of 5 and 50 /C176C, conditions which match conditions
necessary for cellulase activity and would reduce the
need for sterilization and require less cooling. Three
strains of B. coagulans generating lactic acid as the
major anaerobic product were isolated, and strain
36D1 has been the subject of continuing research. B.
coagulans 36D1 generated over 150 g lactic acid l-1
from either 200 g glucose l-1or 200 g xylose l-1in
about 200 h (Ou et al. 2011 ). Similarly, Rallu et al.
(2000 ) obtained 21 insertional mutants of Lc. lactis
from a combination of low pH, elevated temperature
and aerobic conditions. The researchers classiﬁed
these mutants into four classes and concluded that acidtolerance is a complex process which involves phos-
phate and purine nucleotide pools and multiple
transporters.
Heterologous expression of nisin-induced dnaK
from E. coli inLc. lactis improves tolerance to heat,
salt and ethanol stress, particularly at 40 /C176C (Al-Mahin
et al. 2010 ), though the concentrations of lactic acid
were low (1–2 g l
-1). DnaK is believed to transduce
signals to other cellular factors in response toincreased temperature, and also to plays a role in
refolding of thermally damaged proteins.
Further research on tolerant strains
Research has progressed to decrease by-product
formation in some tolerant strains, or to use these
strains directly for the conversion of lignocellulosic
hydrolysates. For example, thermotolerant B. coagu-
lans P4-102B with knockouts in the native
L-LDH
(ldh) and acetolactate synthase ( alsS) genes, regains
anaerobic growth after a mutation in glycerol dehy-
drogenase ( gldA ) causes the enzyme to act as a D-
LDH, resulting in 90 g D-lactate l-1from glucose after
48 h (Wang et al. 2011 ). Interestingly, for B. coagu-
lans NL01 both acetate and levulinate exhibited aBiotechnol Lett (2015) 37:955–972 967
123toxic effect, while 2 g formate l-1showed a stimula-
tory effect, and in corn stover hydrolysate this strain
consumed xylose, arabinose and glucose simulta-neously (Ouyang et al. 2012 ).B. coagulans MXL-9
grew on a synthetic mixture of 17 g l
-1each of
glucose, xylose and arabinose, resulting in about 90 %yield on the three sugars after 36 h in the pH range of
6–6.5 (Bischoff et al. 2010 ). MXL-9 showed a 50 %
decrease in OD after 24 h with 2.5–5 g furfural l
-1and
5-HMF, but was nevertheless able to ferment corn
ﬁber hydrolysates without overliming to over 40 g
lactic acid l-1.Bacillus XZL9, which was isolated
speciﬁcally for L-lactic acid formation from xylose at
50/C176C, generated 134 g L-lactic acid l-1in 218 h in a
fed-batch fermentation, and about 74 g L-lactic acid
l-1from corncob molasses (Wang et al. 2010b ).
Lactate-generating fungi have also been the subject of
strain improvement: subjecting R. oryzae to low
energy ions led to mutants with increased metabolism
of both xylose and glucose to 80 g lactic acid l-1in
70 h, although the rate of xylose conversion remainedmuch slower than the rate of glucose conversion
(Wang et al. 2009 ).
Conclusions
The microbial production of lactic acid is a maturing
technology which has, for over a decade, been
successfully commercialized by several companies.With a current production cost on the order of a dollar
per kg (Posada et al. 2012 ), even the highest producing
strains generate a culture having lactic acid valued atless than $0.25 per liter. At such a low value for the
fermentation product, the cost of the medium and
operating conditions become critical in achieving aneconomic target for lactic acid production. Signiﬁcant
improvements have been achieved by isolating new
microbes, or enhancing existing microbes for greatertolerance to high temperature and low pH in order to
reduce contamination and operational costs. Never-
theless, the practical goal of improving microbe
characteristics should be accompanied by a funda-
mental understanding of how cells response to suchenvironments (e.g., membrane integrity, lactate trans-
port, enzyme stability). Bioinformatic tools, for
example, though rarely applied for lactic acid produc-tion, could provide better enzymes and processes.
With the consistent desirability for using inexpensiveagriculturally-generated residues, and reducing the
cost of the medium, research should continue to
provide scalable understanding into cellular responsesto such substrates. Research on bioreactor operational
modes, such as nutrient-limited (N, P, etc.) fed-batch
processes, could not only provide further insights intocellular responses to environmental conditions, but
could make signiﬁcant improvements in lactic acid
productivity, yield and ﬁnal concentration.
